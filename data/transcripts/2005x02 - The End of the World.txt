NINTH DOCTOR: Right then, Rose Tyler - you tell me, where do you want to go? Backwards or forwards in time. What's it going to be?
ROSE: Forwards.
NINTH DOCTOR: How far?
ROSE: One hundred years.
NINTH DOCTOR: There you go, step outside those doors, it's the twenty-second century.
ROSE: You're kidding.
NINTH DOCTOR: That's a bit boring though, do you want to go further?
ROSE: Fine by me!
NINTH DOCTOR: Ten thousand years in the future. Step outside, it's the year 12005, the New Roman Empire.
ROSE: You think you're so impressive.
NINTH DOCTOR: I am so impressive!
ROSE: You wish!
NINTH DOCTOR: Right then, you asked for it. I know exactly where to go.
NINTH DOCTOR: Hold on!
ROSE: Where are we?
ROSE: What's out there?
NINTH DOCTOR: You lot. You spend all your time thinking about dying. Like you're going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or asteroids. But you never take time to imagine the impossible. Maybe you survive. This is the year 5.5/apple/26. Five billion years in your future. This is the day... hold on...
NINTH DOCTOR: This is the day the sun expands. Welcome to the end of the world.
LOUDSPEAKER: Shuttles 5 and 6 now docking. Guests are reminded that platform 1 forbids the use of weapons, teleportation and religion. Earth Death is scheduled for 15:39, followed by drinks in the Manchester Suite.
ROSE: So, when it says 'guests' does that mean people?
NINTH DOCTOR: Depends what you mean by people.
ROSE: I mean people. What do you mean?
NINTH DOCTOR: Aliens.
ROSE: What are they doing on board this spaceship? What's it all for?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not really a spaceship. More like an observation deck. The great and the good are gathering to watch the planet burn.
ROSE: What for?
NINTH DOCTOR: Fun.
NINTH DOCTOR: Mind you, when I said the great and the good, what I mean is, the rich.
ROSE: But, hold on, they did this once on Newsround Extra - the sun expanding - that takes hundreds of years.
NINTH DOCTOR: Millions. But the planet's now property of the National Trust. They've been keeping it preserved. See down there?
NINTH DOCTOR: Gravity satellite. That's holding back the sun.
ROSE: The planet looks the same as ever. I thought the continents shifted and things.
NINTH DOCTOR: They did. And the trust shifted them back. That's a classic Earth. But now the money's run out, nature takes over!
ROSE: How long has it got?
NINTH DOCTOR: About half an hour. And the planet gets roasted.
ROSE: Is that why we're here? I mean, is that what you do? Jump in at the last minute and save the Earth?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm not saving it. Time's up.
ROSE: But what about the people?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's empty! They're all gone. All left.
ROSE: Just me then.
STEWARD: Who the hell are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh! That's nice, thanks.
STEWARD: But how did you get in? This is a maximum hospitality zone. The guests have disembarked! They're on their way any second now!
NINTH DOCTOR: That's me, I'm a guest, look! I've got an invitation!
NINTH DOCTOR: Look, there you see? It's fine, see? The Doctor plus one. I'm the Doctor, this is Rose Tyler. She's my plus one. That alright?
STEWARD: Well… obviously.
STEWARD: Apologies, et cetera. If you're on-board, we'd better start. Enjoy.
NINTH DOCTOR: The paper's slightly psychic. Shows them whatever I want them to see. Saves a lot of time.
ROSE: He's blue.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah.
ROSE: Okay…
STEWARD: We have in attendance, the Doctor and Rose Tyler. Thank you! All staff to their positions.
STEWARD: Hurry now! Thank you, as quick as we can! Come along, come along! And now, might I introduce the next honoured guest, representing the forest of Cheem, we have Trees. Namely, Jabe, Lute and Coffa.
STEWARD: There will be an exchange of gifts representing peace. If you can keep the room circulating, thank-you. Next, from the solicitors Jolco and Jolco, the Moxx of Balhoon.
STEWARD: And next, from Financial Family Seven, we have the Adherents of the Repeated Meme.
STEWARD: The inventors of hyposlip travel systems, the brothers Hop Pyleen. Thank you!
STEWARD: Cal 'Spark Plug'.
STEWARD: Mr. and Mrs. Pakoo. 
STEWARD: The Ambassadors from the City State of Binding Light.
JABE: The Gift of Peace.
JABE: I bring you a cutting of my Grandfather.
NINTH DOCTOR: Thank you!
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, gifts... erm...
NINTH DOCTOR: I give you in return, air from my lungs.
JABE: How… intimate.
NINTH DOCTOR: There's more where that came from.
JABE: I bet there is...
STEWARD: Sponsor of the main event, please welcome the Face of Bo.
NINTH DOCTOR: The Moxx of Balhoon.
MOXX OF BALHOON: My felicitations on this historical happenstance. I give you the gift of bodily salivas.
NINTH DOCTOR: Thank you very much.
NINTH DOCTOR: Ah! The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. I bring you air from my lungs.
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith.
STEWARD: And last but not least, our very special guest. Ladies and Gentlemen, and Trees and Multiforms. Consider the Earth below. In memory of this dying world, we call forth The Last Human.
STEWARD: The Lady Cassandra O'Brien Dot Delta Seventeen.
CASSANDRA: Oh, now, don't stare. I know, I know it's shocking, isn't it? I've had my chin completely taken away and look at the difference! Look how thin I am.
CASSANDRA: Thin and dainty! I don't look a day over two thousand. Moisturize me, moisturize me.
CASSANDRA: Truly, I am The Last Human.
CASSANDRA: My father was a Texan. My mother was from the Arctic Desert. They were born on the Earth and were the last to be buried in the soil.
CASSANDRA: I have come to honour them and...
CASSANDRA: ... say goodbye. Oh, no tears.
CASSANDRA: No tears. I'm sorry. But behold! I bring gifts. From Earth itself - the last remaining ostrich egg.
CASSANDRA: Legend says it had a wingspan of 50 feet and blew fire from its nostrils.
CASSANDRA: Or was that my third husband?
CASSANDRA: Who knows! Oh don't laugh. I'll get laughter lines!
CASSANDRA: And here, another rarity. According to the archives, this was called an iPod. It stores classical music from humanity's greatest composers.
CASSANDRA: Play on!
STEWARD: Refreshments will now be served. Earth Death in 30 minutes.
JABE: Doctor?
JABE: Thank you.
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith.
STEWARD: No, you're very kind, but I'm just the Steward.
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith.
STEWARD: Oh, yes. Thank you. Of course.
JABE: Identify species. Please identify species.
JABE: Now, stop it. Identify his race. Where's he from?
JABE: It's impossible.
ROSE: Sorry, am I allowed to be in here?
RAFFALO: You have to give us permission to talk.
ROSE: Uh… you... have permission...?
RAFFALO: Thank you! And, no. You're not in the way. Guests are allowed anywhere.
ROSE: 'Kay.
ROSE: What's your name?
RAFFALO: Raffalo.
ROSE: Raffalo?
RAFFALO: Yes, Miss. I won't be long, I've just got to carry out some maintenance.
RAFFALO: There's a tiny little glitch in the Face of Bo suite. There must be something blocking the system - he's not getting any hot water.
ROSE: So, you're a plumber?
RAFFALO: That's right, Miss.
ROSE: They still have plumbers?
RAFFALO: I hope so! Else I'm out of a job!
ROSE: Where are you from?
RAFFALO: Crespallion.
ROSE: That's a planet, is it?
RAFFALO: No, Crespallion's part of the Jaggit Brocade, affiliated to the Scarlet Junction, Convex 56. And where are you from, Miss? 
RAFFALO: ... If you don't mind me asking.
ROSE: No! Not at all. Erm... I dunno, a long way away... I just sort of, hitched a lift with this man. 
ROSE: I didn't even think about it... I don't even know who he is... he's a complete stranger...
ROSE: Anyway, don't let me keep you. Good luck with it!
RAFFALO: Thank you, Miss. And--
RAFFALO: Thank you for the permission. Not many people are that considerate.
ROSE: 'Kay. See you later.
RAFFALO: Now then.
RAFFALO: Control - I'm at Junction 19 and I think the problem's coming from in here. I'll go inside and have a look.
RAFFALO: What's that? Is there something in there?
RAFFALO: Oh! Who are you, then?
RAFFALO: Hold on! I... if you're an upgrade I just need to register you, that's all. Oh, come back!
RAFFALO: Ah, there you are. Now, I just need to register your ident. 
RAFFALO: Oh, there's two of you! Got yourself a little mate!
RAFFALO: I think I'd better report this to control. How many of you are there?
RAFFALO: What are you? Oh, no. No. Nooooo!
STEWARD: What's that? Well, how should I know?
STEWARD: Would the owner of the blue box in private gallery 15 please report to the steward's office immediately. Guests are reminded that use of all teleportation devices is strictly forbidden under Peace Treaty 5.4/cup/16. Thank you.
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 25 minutes. Earth Death in 25 minutes.
ROSE: Oh, thanks.
ROSE: Hello! My name's Rose. That's a sort of plant. We might be related...
ROSE: I'm talking to a twig.
NINTH DOCTOR: Oi, now, careful with that. Park it properly. No scratches.
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose? Are you in there?
NINTH DOCTOR: Aye aye! 
NINTH DOCTOR: What do you think, then?
ROSE: Great! Yeah... fine. Once you get past the slightly psychic paper...
ROSE: They're just, so alien.
ROSE: The aliens. Are so alien. You look at 'em... and they're alien.
NINTH DOCTOR: Good thing I didn't take you to the Deep South.
ROSE: Where are you from?
NINTH DOCTOR: All over the place.
ROSE: They all speak English.
NINTH DOCTOR: No - you just hear English. It's a gift of the TARDIS. Telepathic field, gets inside your brain - translates.
ROSE: It's inside my brain?
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, in a good way.
ROSE: Your machine gets inside my head. It gets inside and it changes my mind, and you didn't even ask?
NINTH DOCTOR: I didn't think about it like that.
ROSE: No! You were too busy thinking up cheap shots about the Deep South! Who are you then, Doctor? What are you called? What sort of alien are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm just The Doctor.
ROSE: From what planet?
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, it's not as if you'll know where it is!
ROSE: Where are you from?!
NINTH DOCTOR: What does it matter?
ROSE: Tell me who you are!
NINTH DOCTOR: This is who I am, right here, right now, alright? All that counts is here and now, and this is me!
ROSE: Yeah, and I'm here too because you brought me here, so just tell me!
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 20 minutes. Earth Death in 20 minutes.
ROSE: Alright… as my mate Shareen says... don't argue with the designated driver...
ROSE: Can't exactly call for a taxi... there's no signal. We're out of range. Just a bit!
NINTH DOCTOR: Tell you what...
NINTH DOCTOR: With a little bit of jiggery pokery...
ROSE: Is that a technical term, 'jiggery pokery'?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery, what about you?
ROSE: Nah, failed hullabaloo.
NINTH DOCTOR: Oooh.
NINTH DOCTOR: There you go.
JACKIE: Hello?
ROSE: Mum?
JACKIE: Oh, what is it? What's wrong? What have I done now? Oh, this red top's falling to bits! You should get your money back. Go on! There must be something, you never phone in the middle of the day!
JACKIE: What's so funny?
ROSE: Nothing! You alright, though?
JACKIE: Yeah! Why wouldn't I be?
ROSE: What day is it?
JACKIE: Wednesday. All day. You got a hangover? Oh, I tell you what, put a quid in that lottery syndicate, I'll pay you back later.
ROSE: Yeah, um, I was just calling 'cause I might be late home.
JACKIE: Is there something wrong?
ROSE: No! I'm fine! Top of the world!
NINTH DOCTOR: Think that's amazing, you want to see the bill.
ROSE: That was 5 billion years ago. So... she's dead now. Five billion years later, my mum's dead.
NINTH DOCTOR: Bundle of laughs, you are.
NINTH DOCTOR: That's not supposed to happen...
STEWARD: Well, what was it? I'm just getting green lights at this end.
STEWARD: Honoured guests may be reassured that gravity pockets may cause slight turbulence, thanking you.
STEWARD: The whole place shook! I felt it! I've hosted all sorts of events on platforms 1, 3, 6 and 15 and I've never felt the slightest tremor. I warn you, if this lot decide to sue... I'm going to scan the infrastructure.
STEWARD: What's that?
STEWARD: Control, I don't want to worry you, but I'm picking up readings...
STEWARD: I have no idea! Well, they're small, and the scan says they're metal...
STEWARD: I don't know what they look like!
STEWARD: Although, I imagine they might look rather like that... you're not on the guest list... how did you get on board...?
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter deactivated.
STEWARD: No. No!
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter descending.
STEWARD: No! Sunfilter, up! No, no, no!
STEWARD: Sunfilter up! Sunfilter up!
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter descending.
MOXX OF BALHOON: ... this is the Bad Wolf scenario...
NINTH DOCTOR: That wasn't a gravity pocket. I know gravity pockets and they don't feel like that.
NINTH DOCTOR: What do you think, Jabe? Listened to the engines - they pitched up about 30 hertz, is that dodgy or what?
JABE: It's the sound of metal, it doesn't make any sense to me.
NINTH DOCTOR: Where's the engine room?
JABE: I don't know... but the maintenance duct is just behind our guest's suite, I could show you. And... 
JABE: ... your wife.
NINTH DOCTOR: She's not my wife.
JABE: Partner?
NINTH DOCTOR: No.
JABE: Concubine?
NINTH DOCTOR: Nope.
JABE: Prostitute…
ROSE: Whatever I am, it must be invisible, do you mind? Tell you what, you two go and pollinate, I'm going to catch up with family. Quick word with Michael Jackson.
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't start a fight.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm all yours.
ROSE: And I want you home by midnight!
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 15 minutes. Earth Death in 15 minutes.
NINTH DOCTOR: Who's in charge of platform 1? Is there a captain or what?
JABE: There's just the steward and the staff. All the rest is controlled by the metal man.
NINTH DOCTOR: You mean the computer? But who controls that?
JABE: The Corporation. They move platform 1 from one artistic event to another.
NINTH DOCTOR: But there's no one from the corporation on board.
JABE: They're not needed. This facility is purely automatic. It's the height of the alpha class. Nothing can go wrong.
NINTH DOCTOR: Unsinkable?
JABE: If you like. The nautical metaphor is appropriate.
NINTH DOCTOR: You're telling me. I was on board another ship once. They said that was unsinkable... I ended up clinging to an iceberg, it wasn't half cold.
NINTH DOCTOR: So, what you're saying is, if we get in trouble there's no one to help us out?
JABE: I'm afraid not.
NINTH DOCTOR: Fantastic.
JABE: I don't understand. In what way is that fantastic?
CASSANDRA: Soon, the sun will blossom into a red giant, and my home will die. That's where I used to live, when I was a little boy. Down there. Mummy and Daddy had a little house built into the side of the Los Angeles Crevice. 
CASSANDRA: I had such fun.
ROSE: What happened to everyone else? The Human Race - where did it go?
CASSANDRA: They say Mankind has touched every star in the sky.
ROSE: So, you're not the last human.
CASSANDRA: I am the last pure human. The others... mingled.
CASSANDRA: Oh, they call themselves 'New Humans' and 'Proto-humans' and 'Digi-humans' even 'Human-ish' but you know what I call them?
CASSANDRA: Mongrels.
ROSE: Right. And you stayed behind.
CASSANDRA: I kept myself pure.
ROSE: How many operations have you had?
CASSANDRA: 708. Next week, it's 709, I'm having my blood bleached. Is that why you wanted a word? You could be flatter, Rose. You've got a little bit of a chin poking out.
ROSE: I'd rather die.
CASSANDRA: Honestly, it doesn't hurt--
ROSE: No, I mean it. I'd rather die. It's better to die than live like you - a bitchy trampoline.
CASSANDRA: Oh well. What do you know.
ROSE: I was born on that planet. And so was my mum, and so was my dad and that makes me officially the last human being in this room, 'cause you're not human. You've had it all nipped and tucked and flattened till there's nothing left. Anything human got chucked in the bin. You're just skin, Cassandra. Lipstick and skin. Nice talking.
NINTH DOCTOR: So, tell me, Jabe. What's a tree like you doing in a place like this?
JABE: Respect for the Earth.
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Everyone on this platform's worth zillions.
JABE: Well… perhaps it's a case of having to be seen at the right occasions.
NINTH DOCTOR: In case your share prices drop? I know you lot. You've got massive forests everywhere, roots everywhere, and there's always money in land.
JABE: All the same. You respect the Earth as family. So many species evolved from that planet. Mankind is only one. I'm another. My ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below. And I'm a direct descendant of the tropical rainforest.
NINTH DOCTOR: Excuse me.
JABE: And what about your ancestry, Doctor? Perhaps you could tell a story or two... perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing else left...
JABE: I scanned you earlier. The metal machine had trouble identifying your species - refused to admit your existence.
JABE: And even when it named you, I wouldn't believe it. But it was right.
JABE: I know where you're from. Forgive me for intruding, but it's remarkable that you even exist. I just want to say how sorry I am.
NINTH DOCTOR: Is it me, or is it a bit nippy?
NINTH DOCTOR: Fair do's, though, that's a great bit of air conditioning. Sort of, nice and old fashioned. Bet they call it 'retro'.
NINTH DOCTOR: Gotcha.
NINTH DOCTOR: What the hell's that?
JABE: Is it part of the 'retro'?
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't think so. Hold on.
NINTH DOCTOR: Hey! Nice liana!
JABE: Thank you! We're not supposed to show them in public.
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't worry, I won't tell anybody.
NINTH DOCTOR: Now then. Who's been bringing the pets on board?
JABE: What does it do?
NINTH DOCTOR: Sabotage.
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 10 minutes.
NINTH DOCTOR: And the temperature's about to rocket. Come on.
CASSANDRA: The planet's end. Come gather! Come gather! Bid farewell to the cradle of civilization. Let us mourn her with a traditional ballad.
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on! Get back!
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter rising. Sunfilter rising.
JABE: Was the Steward in there?!
NINTH DOCTOR: You can smell him. Hold on - there's another sun filter programmed to descend.
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter descending. Sunfilter descending.
ROSE: Let me out!
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter descending.
ROSE: Let me out! Let me out!
NINTH DOCTOR: Anyone in there?
ROSE: Let me out!
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, well, it would be you.
ROSE: Open the door!
NINTH DOCTOR: Hold on! Give us two ticks!
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter descending. Sunfilter descending.
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter rising. Sunfilter rising.
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter rising... Sunfilter descending.
NINTH DOCTOR: This is just what we need. The computer's getting clever.
ROSE: Will you stop mucking about!
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm not mucking about, it's fighting back!
ROSE: Open the door!
NINTH DOCTOR: Hang on!
ROSE: The locks melted!
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter descending. Sunfilter descending.
LOUDSPEAKER: Sunfilter rising. Sunfilter rising.
NINTH DOCTOR: The whole thing's jammed. I can't open the doors. Stay there! Don't move!
ROSE: Where'm I gonna go?! Ipswich?!
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 5 minutes.
JABE: The metal machine confirms. The spider devices have infiltrated the whole of platform one.
CASSANDRA: How's that possible? Our private rooms are protected by a code wall. Moisturize me, moisturize me.
MOXX OF BALHOON: Summon the Steward!
JABE: I'm afraid the Steward is dead.
MOXX OF BALHOON: Who killed him?
CASSANDRA: This whole event was sponsored by the Face of Bo! He invited us!
CASSANDRA: Talk to the face! Talk to the face!
NINTH DOCTOR: Easy way of finding out. Someone bought a little pet on board.
NINTH DOCTOR: Let's send him back to Master.
CASSANDRA: The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. J'accuse!
NINTH DOCTOR: That's all very well, and really kind of obvious, but if you stop and think about it...
NINTH DOCTOR: A Repeated Meme is just an idea. And that's all they are. An idea.
NINTH DOCTOR: Remote controlled Droids. Nice little cover for the real troublemaker. Go on, Jimbo!
NINTH DOCTOR: Go home!
CASSANDRA: I bet you were the school swot and never got kissed.
CASSANDRA: At arms!
NINTH DOCTOR: What are you going to do, moisturize me?
CASSANDRA: With acid. Oh, too late anyway. My spiders have control of the mainframe. Oh, you all carried them as gifts, tax free, past every code wall. I'm not just a pretty face.
NINTH DOCTOR: Sabotaging a ship while you're still inside it? How stupid's that?
CASSANDRA: I'd hoped to manufacture a hostage situation with myself as one of the victims. The compensation would have been enormous.
NINTH DOCTOR: Five billion years and it still comes down to money.
CASSANDRA: Do you think it's cheap, looking like this? Flatness costs a fortune. I am The Last Human, Doctor. Me. Not that freaky little kid of yours.
MOXX OF BALHOON: Arrest her!
CASSANDRA: Oh, shut it, pixie. I've still got my final option.
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 3 minutes.
CASSANDRA: And here it comes. You're just as useful dead, all of you. I have shares in your rival companies and they'll triple in price as soon as you're dead. My spiders are primed and ready to destroy the safety systems. How did that old Earth song go? "Burn, baby, burn."
JABE: Then you'll burn with us.
CASSANDRA: Oh, I'm so sorry. I know the use of teleportation is strictly forbidden, but... I'm such a naughty thing. Spiders - activate.
CASSANDRA: Force fields gone with the planet about to explode. At least it'll be quick. Just like my fifth husband. 
CASSANDRA: Oh, shame on me. Buh-bye, darlings! Buh-bye, my darlings...
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels rising.
MOXX OF BALHOON: Reset the computer!
JABE: Only the Steward would know how.
NINTH DOCTOR: No. We can do it by hand. There must be a system restore switch. Jabe, come on.
NINTH DOCTOR: You lot - just chill!
LOUDSPEAKER: Earth Death in 2 minutes. Earth Death in 2 minutes.
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - critical. Heat levels - critical.
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh. And guess where the switch is.
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - rising. Heat levels - rising.
LOUDSPEAKER: External temperature - 5 thousand degrees.
NINTH DOCTOR: You can't. The heat's going to vent through this place.
JABE: I know.
NINTH DOCTOR: Jabe, you're made of wood.
JABE: Then stop wasting time. Time Lord.
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - rising. Heat levels - rising.
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - hazardous.
MOXX OF BALHOON: We're going to die!
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - hazardous.
LOUDSPEAKER: Shields malfunctioning. Shields malfunctioning.
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - critical. Heat levels - critical.
LOUDSPEAKER: Heat levels - rising. Heat levels - rising.
LOUDSPEAKER: Planet explodes in 10... 9...
LOUDSPEAKER: 8... 7... 6... 5... 4...
NINTH DOCTOR: Raise shields!
LOUDSPEAKER: ...1
LOUDSPEAKER: Exoglass repair. Exoglass repair.
ROSE: You alright?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm full of ideas, I'm bristling with them. Idea number one - teleportation through five thousand degrees needs some kind of feed. Idea number two - this feed must be hidden nearby.
NINTH DOCTOR: Idea number three - if you're as clever as me, then a teleportation feed can be reversed.
CASSANDRA: Ah, you should have seen their little alien faces.
CASSANDRA: Oh.
NINTH DOCTOR: The Last Human.
CASSANDRA: So. You passed my little test. Bravo. This makes you eligible to join the er... the human club.
NINTH DOCTOR: People have died, Cassandra. You murdered them.
CASSANDRA: That depends on your definition of 'people'. And that's enough of a technicality to keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries. Take me to court then, Doctor! And watch me smile, and cry, and flutter...
NINTH DOCTOR: And creak?
CASSANDRA: And what?
NINTH DOCTOR: Creak! You're creaking.
CASSANDRA: What? Ah! Ah! I'm drying out! Oh, sweet heavens! Moisturize me! Moisturize me! Where are my surgeons? My lovely boys! It's too hot!
NINTH DOCTOR: You raised the temperature.
CASSANDRA: Have pity! Moisturize me! Oh, Doctor!
ROSE: Help her.
NINTH DOCTOR: Everything has its time and everything dies.
CASSANDRA: I'm... too... young!
LOUDSPEAKER: Shuttles 4 and 6 departing. This unit now closing down for maintenance.
ROSE: The end of the Earth. It's gone. And we were too busy saving ourselves, no one saw it go.
ROSE: All those years... all that history and no one was even looking. It's just...
NINTH DOCTOR: Come with me.
BIG ISSUE SELLER: Big issue!
NINTH DOCTOR: You think it'll last forever. People, and cars and concrete. But it won't. One day, it's all gone. Even the sky.
NINTH DOCTOR: My planet's gone.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's dead. It burned like the Earth. It's just rocks and dust. Before its time.
ROSE: What happened?
NINTH DOCTOR: There was a war. And we lost.
ROSE: A war with who?
ROSE: What about your people?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. They're all gone. I'm the only survivor. I'm left traveling on my own because there's no one else.
ROSE: There's me...
NINTH DOCTOR: You've seen how dangerous it is. Do you want to go home?
ROSE: I don't know. I want...
ROSE: Oh! Can you smell chips?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah. Yeah!
ROSE: I want chips.
NINTH DOCTOR: Me too.
ROSE: Right then, before you get me back in that box, chips it is, and you can pay.
NINTH DOCTOR: No money.
ROSE: What sort of date are you? Come on then, tightwad, chips are on me.
ROSE: We've only got five billion years before the shops close...
