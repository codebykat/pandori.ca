NINTH DOCTOR: Deadly to humans, maybe. 
MICKEY: Jackie!
NINTH DOCTOR: Oi! You want aliens - you've got them. They're inside Downing Street. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on!
SLITHEEN: Reinstate my disguise! Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry!
HARRIET: No, wait!
HARRIET: They're still in there! The emergency protocols! We need them!
JOSEPH: Where've you been?
JOSEPH: I called for help, I sounded the alarm. There was this... lightning! This kind of er... um... electricity, and they all collapsed!
POLICEMAN: I think they're all dead. 
JOSEPH: That's what I'm saying. He did it!
JOSEPH: That man there!
NINTH DOCTOR: I think you will find the Prime Minister is an alien in disguise. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's never going to work, is it? 
POLICEMAN: Nope. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Fair enough. 
ASQUITH: Under the jurisdiction of the Emergency Protocols, I authorize you to execute this man!
NINTH DOCTOR: Uh, well, now, yes. You see, eh... the thing is... if I was you, if I was going to execute someone by backing them against the wall, between you and me, little word of advice...
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't stand them against the lift!
NINTH DOCTOR: Hello!
ROSE: Hide!
ASQUITH: I repeat, the upper floors are under quarantine. You will stay where you are. You will disregard all previous instructions. You will take your orders directly from me. 
SERGEANT: Mr. Green sir - I'm sorry but you've got to come with me. We should evacuate the entire building.  
JOSEPH: Sergeant - have you uh - read the Emergency Protocols? 
SERGEANT: No, sir.
JOSEPH: Then don't question me. 
JOSEPH: Seal off number 10 - secure the ground floor - and if the Doctor makes it downstairs - shoot on sight!
SERGEANT: Well, you heard him! Move out!
ASQUITH: Let the sport begin. 
JOSEPH: *farts*
JOSEPH: I'm getting poisoned by the gas exchange. I need to be naked!
ASQUITH: Rejoice in it! Your body is... magnificent. 
MARGARET: Oh, such fun! Little human children... where are you? Sweet little humankins... come to me... let me kiss you better...
MARGARET: ... kiss you with my big, green lips.
MARGARET: *hisses*
SLITHEEN: We'll keep this floor quarantined as our last hunting ground before the final phase.
MARGARET: My brothers. 
JOSEPH: Happy hunting? 
MARGARET: It's wonderful. The more you prolong it, the more they stink. 
ASQUITH: Sweat... and fear. 
JOSEPH: I can smell an old girl... stale bird... brittle bones. 
MARGARET: And a ripe youngster. All hormones and adrenaline. Fresh enough to bend before she snaps.
HARRIET: No! Take me first! Take me!
NINTH DOCTOR: Out! With me!
NINTH DOCTOR: Who the hell are you?
HARRIET: Harriet Jones - MP for Flydale North. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nice to meet you. 
HARRIET: Likewise. 
NINTH DOCTOR: We need to get to the cabinet rooms! 
HARRIET: The Emergency Protocols are in there! They give instructions on aliens! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Harriet Jones - I like you.
HARRIET: And I like you too. 
NINTH DOCTOR: One more move and my sonic device will triplicate the flammability of this alcohol. Whoof! We all go up. So back off. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Right then. Question time. Who exactly are the Slitheen?
HARRIET: They're aliens. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes. I got that, thanks. 
JOSEPH: Who are you, if not human? 
HARRIET: Who's not human?
ROSE: He's not human. 
HARRIET: He's not human?
NINTH DOCTOR: Can I have a bit of hush?
HARRIET: Sorry. 
NINTH DOCTOR: So - what's the plan?
HARRIET: But he's got a Northern accent. 
ROSE: Lots of planets have a North. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I said hush. Come on! 
NINTH DOCTOR: You've got a spaceship hidden in the North Sea. It's transmitting a signal. You've murdered your way to the top of government - what for? Invasion?
ASQUITH: Why would we invade this God forsaken rock? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Then something's brought the Slitheen race here - what is it? 
ASQUITH: 'The Slitheen race'?
JOSEPH: Slitheen is not our species. Slitheen is our surname. Jocrassa Fel Fotch Pasameer Day Slitheen at your service. 
NINTH DOCTOR: So, you're family. 
JOSEPH: It's a family business. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Then you're out to make a profit. How can you do that on a 'God forsaken rock'? 
ASQUITH: Ahhh… excuse me? Your device will do what? Triplicate the flammability...?
NINTH DOCTOR: Is that what I said? 
ASQUITH: You're making it up!
NINTH DOCTOR: Ah, well! Nice try. Harriet, have a drink. I think you're gonna need it. 
HARRIET: Pass it to the left first. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Sorry. 
ROSE: Thanks. 
ASQUITH: Now we can end this hunt... with a slaughter. 
ROSE: Don't you think we should run? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Fascinating history, Downing Street. Two thousand years ago, this was marshland. 1730, it was occupied by a Mr. Chicken. He was a nice man. 1796, this was the cabinet room - if the cabinet's in session and in danger, these are about the four most safest walls in the whole of Great Britain. 
NINTH DOCTOR: End of lesson. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Installed in 1991. Three inches of steel lining every single wall. They'll never get in.
ROSE: And how do we get out? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Ah.
JOSEPH: He is safely contained. Now, cut off communications inside that room, then summon the family, it's time we finished with this insane planet for good!
REPORTER: And there's still no word from inside Downing Street, though we are getting even more new arrivals. 
REPORTER: That's group Captain Tennant James of the RAF - though why he's been summoned, I've no idea. 
REPORTER: And that's ah... Ewan McAllister. Deputy Secretary for the Scottish Parliament. And this is most unusual! 
REPORTER: I'm told that is Sylvia Dillane - chairman of the North Sea Boating Club. Quite what connects these people, we have no idea. 
MARGARET: Group Captain - delighted you could make it. We're meeting upstairs. 
MARGARET: That's the spirit. Off you go.
MARGARET: Good to see you!
MARGARET: Come on through!
ASQUITH: Ah! Sergeant - now that the Doctor's been neutralized, the upper levels are out of bounds - to everyone.
SERGEANT: Then who are they?
ASQUITH: Ahh, Sergeant. I want you to liaise with communications - the acting Prime Minister will be making a public address. He will speak to the nations of the world. 
MARGARET: There you are - if you'd just like to go through and get changed.
MARGARET: Now, if you'd like to head down to the end corridor, it's first on the left. 
SLITHEEN: Thank you. 
JACKIE: Have you got anything stronger? 
MICKEY: No chance, I've seen you when you've had a few - this ain't time for a conga. 
JACKIE: We've gotta tell someone. 
MICKEY: Who do we trust? For all we know, they've all got big bog monsters inside of them. I mean, this is what he does, Jacks.
MICKEY: Everywhere he goes - death and destruction, and he's got Rose in the middle of it.
JACKIE: Has he got a great big green thing inside him, then? 
MICKEY: I wouldn't put it past him. 
MICKEY: But like it or not, he's the only person who knows how to fight these things. 
JACKIE: I thought I was gonna die. 
MICKEY: Come on, yeah? If anyone's gonna cry, it's gonna be me. Now, you're safe in my flat, Jacks - no one's gonna look for you here, especially since you hate me so much.
JACKIE: You saved my life. God, that's embarrassing. 
MICKEY: You're telling me. 
JACKIE: He wanted me dead. And he's still out there, Mickey...
JACKIE: That policeman... that thing...
POLICEMAN: Right - you head off. You're in full control, I've got one or two things that still need doing. I haven't quite finished with Mrs. Tyler yet...
JOSEPH: Is that all of us?
MARGARET: All the family except Sit Fel Fotch. He's found a hunt of his own. 
JOSEPH: Ah!
NINTH DOCTOR: What was his name? 
HARRIET: Which one?
NINTH DOCTOR: This one - the secretary or whatever he was called. 
HARRIET: I don't know. I talked to him. I brought him a cup of coffee. I never asked his name.
NINTH DOCTOR: Sorry. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Right, what have we got? Any terminals? Anything?
ROSE: No. The place is antique. What I don't get, is when they killed the Prime Minister, why didn't they use him as a disguise? 
NINTH DOCTOR: He's too slim - they're big old beasts, they need to fit inside big humans. 
ROSE: But the Slitheen are about 8 feet, how do they squeeze inside?
NINTH DOCTOR: That's the device around their necks - compression field - literally shrinks them down a bit. That's why there's all that gas, it's a big exchange. 
ROSE: Wish I had a compression field, I could fit a size smaller. 
HARRIET: Excuse me, people are dead, this is not the time for making jokes. 
ROSE: Sorry... you get used to this stuff when you're friends with him. 
HARRIET: Well, that's a strange friendship. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Harriet Jones - I've heard that name before - Harriet Jones. You're not famous for anything, are you?
HARRIET: Huh! Hardly. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rings a bell, Harriet Jones...
HARRIET: Lifelong back bencher I'm afraid, and a fat lot of use I'm being now - the protocols are redundant, they list the people who can help and they're all dead downstairs.
ROSE: Hasn't it got like, defense codes and things? Can we just launch a nuclear bomb at 'em?
HARRIET: You're a very violent young woman...
ROSE: I'm serious! We could!
HARRIET: Well, there's nothing like that in here. Nuclear strikes do need a release code, yes, but it's kept secret by the United Nations. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Say that again. 
HARRIET: What, about the codes? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Anything. All of it. 
HARRIET: Um, well... the British Isles can't gain access to atomic weapons without a special resolution from the UN. 
ROSE: Like that's ever stopped them.
HARRIET: Exactly, given our past record - and I voted against that, thank you very much. The codes have been taken out of the government's hands and given to the UN. 
HARRIET: Is it important?
NINTH DOCTOR: Everything's important. 
HARRIET: If we only knew what the Slitheen wanted. Listen to me, I'm saying 'Slitheen' as if it's normal. 
ROSE: What do they want, though? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, it's just one family so it's not an invasion. They don't want Slitheen world... they're out to make money, which means they want to use something, something here on Earth... some kind of asset. 
HARRIET: Like what? Gold? Oil? Water?
NINTH DOCTOR: You're very good at this. 
HARRIET: Thank you. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Harriet Jones - why do I know that name?
ROSE: Oh! That's me. 
HARRIET: But we're sealed off - how did you get a signal? 
ROSE: He zapped it! Super-phone. 
HARRIET: Then we can phone for help! You must have contacts. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Dead downstairs, yeah. 
ROSE: It's Mickey. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, tell your stupid boyfriend we're busy. 
ROSE: Yeah, he's not so stupid after all.
MICKEY: No, no, no, no, no - not just alien, but like, proper alien. All stinking, and wet, and disgusting. And more to the point, it wanted to kill us!
JACKIE: I could've died!
ROSE: Is she alright, though? Don't put her on, just tell me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Is that Rickey? Don't talk, just shut up and go to your computer.
MICKEY: It's Mickey. And why should I?
NINTH DOCTOR: Mickey the Idiot - I might just choke before I finish this sentence, but eh - I need you. 
MICKEY: It says password. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Say again.
MICKEY: It's asking for the password. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Buffalo - two Fs, one L. 
JACKIE: So, what's that website? 
MICKEY: All the secret information known to mankind. See, they've known about aliens for years, they just kept us in the dark. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Mickey, you were born in the dark.
ROSE: Oh, leave him alone. 
MICKEY: Thank you. Password again. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Just repeat it, every time. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Big Ben - why did the Slitheen hit Big Ben?
HARRIET: You said to gather the experts - to kill them. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That lot would've gathered for a weather balloon, you don't need to crash land in the middle of London. 
ROSE: The Slitheen were hiding - and then they put the entire planet on red alert, what would they do that for?
JACKIE: Oh, listen to her.
ROSE: At least I'm trying! 
JACKIE: Well, I've got a question if you don't mind. Because since that man walked into our lives, I have been attacked in the streets. I have had creatures from the pits of hell in my own living room, and my daughter's disappeared off the face of the Earth.
ROSE: I told you what happened.
JACKIE: I'm talking to him. 'Cause I've seen this life of yours, Doctor. And maybe you get off on it. And maybe you think it's all clever and smart, but you tell me. Just answer me this - is my daughter safe? 
ROSE: I'm fine. 
JACKIE: Is she safe? Will she always be safe? Can you promise me that? 
JACKIE: Well, what's the answer? 
MICKEY: We're in. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Right then - on the left, there's a tab - an icon - little concentric circles - click on that. 
MICKEY: What is it?
NINTH DOCTOR: The Slitheen have got a spaceship in the North Sea and it's transmitting that signal, now hush, let me work out what it's saying. 
JACKIE: He'll have to answer me one day.
MICKEY: Hush!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's some sort of message.
ROSE: What's it say?
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't know - it's on a loop, keeps repeating. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Hush!
MICKEY: That's not me. 
MICKEY: Go and see who that is. 
JACKIE: It's three o'clock in the morning. 
MICKEY: Well go and tell them that. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's beaming out into space, who's it for? 
JACKIE: Alright!
POLICEMAN: Mrs. Tyler. 
JACKIE: It's him! It's the thing, it's the Slickeen! 
MICKEY: They've found us. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Mickey, I need that signal. 
ROSE: Never mind the signal, mum, just get out! Get out! Get out!
MICKEY: We can't, it's by the front door. 
MICKEY: Oh, my God. It's unmasking. It's gonna kill us. 
HARRIET: There's got to be some way of stopping them!
HARRIET: You're supposed to be the expert, think of something!
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm trying!
MICKEY: I'll take it on, Jackie. You just run. Don't look back. Just run. 
ROSE: That's my mother. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Right! If we're going to find their weakness, we need to find out where they're from - which planet. So, judging by their face and shape, that narrows it down to five thousand planets within traveling distance. What else do we know about them? Information!
ROSE: They're green. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yep, narrows it down. 
ROSE: Uh, good sense of smell.
NINTH DOCTOR: Narrows it down.
ROSE: They can smell adrenaline. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Narrows it down. 
HARRIET: The compression technology. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Narrows it down.
ROSE: The spaceship in the Thames - you said slipstream engine? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Narrows it down. 
MICKEY: It's getting in!
ROSE: Oh! They hunt like it's a ritual. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Narrows it down.
HARRIET: Wait a minute! Did you notice, when they fart - if you'll pardon the word - it doesn't just smell like a fart - if you'll pardon the word - it's something else, what is it, it's more like uh... um...
ROSE: Bad breath!
HARRIET: That's it!
NINTH DOCTOR: Calcium decay! Now that narrows it down!
ROSE: We're getting there, mum!
MICKEY: Too late!
NINTH DOCTOR: Calcium phosphate, organic calcium, living calcium, creatures made out of living calcium, what else, what else - hyphenated sodium - yes! That narrows it down to one planet! Raxacorricofallapatorius!
MICKEY: Oh, yeah, great. We could write 'em a letter.
NINTH DOCTOR: Get into the kitchen!
JACKIE: My God, it's going to rip us apart!
NINTH DOCTOR: Calcium, recombined with compression field - ascetic acid. Vinegar!
HARRIET: Just like Hannibal!  
NINTH DOCTOR: Just like Hannibal. Mickey, have you got any vinegar?
MICKEY: How should I know? 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's your kitchen. 
ROSE: Cupboard by the sink, middle shelf. 
JACKIE: Give it here, what do you need?
NINTH DOCTOR: Anything with vinegar!
JACKIE: Gherkins! 
JACKIE: Yeah! Pickled onions! 
JACKIE: Picked eggs!
NINTH DOCTOR: You kiss this man?
ROSE: Hannibal? 
HARRIET: Hannibal crossed the Alps by dissolving boulders with vinegar. 
ROSE: Oh. Well, there you go then. 
ROSE: Phew!
ASQUITH: He's dead. Sip Fel Fotch Pasameer- Day Slitheen is dead. 
JOSEPH: I felt it. How could that happen? 
ASQUITH: Somebody must've got lucky. 
JOSEPH: That's the last piece of luck anyone on this rock will ever have. 
JOSEPH: Ladies and Gentlemen - Nations of the World - Human Kind. The greatest experts in extra-terrestrial events came here tonight. They gathered in the common cause. But the news I bring you now is grave indeed. 
JOSEPH: The experts are dead. Murdered - right in front of me by alien hands. Peoples of the Earth, heed my words. These visitors do not come in peace.
MICKEY: Listen to this. 
JOSEPH: Our inspectors have searched the sky above our heads and they have found massive weapons of destruction, capable of being deployed within 45 seconds.
NINTH DOCTOR: What?
JOSEPH: Our technicians can - baffle - the alien probes. But not for long. We are facing extinction. Unless we strike first. The United Kingdom stands directly beneath the belly of the mother ship. I beg the United Nations - pass an emergency resolution. Give us the access codes! A nuclear strike at the heart of the ship is our only chance of survival. Because... from this moment on... it is my solemn duty to inform you... planet Earth is at war.
NINTH DOCTOR: He's making it up. There's no weapons up there, there's no threat. He just invented it.
HARRIET: Do you think they'll believe him?
ROSE: They did last time. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's why the Slitheen went for spectacle. They want the whole world panicking, because you lot - you get scared, you lash out. 
ROSE: They release the defense codes...
NINTH DOCTOR: And the Slitheen go nuclear. 
HARRIET: But why? 
NINTH DOCTOR: You get the codes, release the missiles. But not into space because there's nothing there. You attack every other country on Earth, they retaliate, fight back. World War Three - whole planet gets nuked. 
MARGARET: And we can sit through it in our spaceship waiting in the Thames. Not crashed. Just parked. They'll be two minutes away. 
HARRIET: But you'll destroy the planet, this beautiful place. What for?
NINTH DOCTOR: Profit. That's what the signal is beaming into space - an advert. 
MARGARET: Sale of the century. We reduce the Earth to molten slag, then sell it. Piece by piece. Radioactive chucks capable of powering every cut-price star liner and budget cargo ship. There's a recession out there, Doctor. People are buying cheap. This rock becomes raw fuel. 
NINTH DOCTOR: At the cost of 5 billion lives.
MARGARET: Bargain. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Then I give you the choice - leave this planet or I'll stop you. 
MARGARET: What? You? Trapped in your box? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes. Me. 
REPORTER: Yesterday saw the start of a brave new world. Today might see it end. The streets are deserted. Everyone's home - just waiting. As the future is decided in New York. 
NEWSREADER: It's midnight here in New York. The United Nations has gathered. England has provided them with absolute proof that the massive weapons of mass destruction do exist. The security counsel will be making a resolution in a matter of minutes. 
NEWSREADER: And once the codes are released, humanities first interplanetary war begins. 
JOSEPH: Sergeant. We'll take the call in the Prime Minister's office. Maintain the oppositions. Good luck.
MARGARET: Oh! Look at that! The telephone is actually red. 
JOSEPH: How long 'til they phone?!
ASQUITH: Counting down...!
JACKIE: Alright, Doctor. I'm not saying I trust you, but there must be something you can do.
HARRIET: If we ferment the port, we could make ascetic acid.
ROSE: Mickey, any luck?
MICKEY: There's loads of emergency numbers - they're all on voicemail.
HARRIET: Voicemail dooms us all. 
ROSE: If we could just get out of here...
NINTH DOCTOR: There's a way out.
ROSE: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: There's always been a way out. 
ROSE: Then why don't we use it? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Because I can't guarantee your daughter will be safe. 
JACKIE: Don't you dare. Whatever it is, don't you dare. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's the thing, if I don't dare, everyone dies. 
ROSE: Do it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You don't even know what it is, you'd just let me?
ROSE: Yeah. 
JACKIE: Please, Doctor. Please! She's my daughter, she's just a kid! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Do you think I don't know that? Because this is my life, Jackie, it's not fun, it's not smart, it's just standing up and making a decision because nobody else will.
ROSE: Then what're you waiting for? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I could save the world but lose you.
HARRIET: Except it's not your decision, Doctor. It's mine.
JACKIE: And who the hell are you? 
HARRIET: Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North. The only elected representative in this room, chosen by the people, for the people, and on behalf of the people I command you. Do it.
JOSEPH: Victory... should be naked!
ROSE: How do we get out?
NINTH DOCTOR: We don't. We stay here. 
NEWS READER: The counsel is voting. The results should be known any second now. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Use the buffalo password, it overrides everything. 
JACKIE: What're you doing?
MICKEY: Hacking into the Royal Navy. 
MICKEY: We're in. Here it is, uh...  H.M.S. Taurean, Trafalgar Class Submarine, 10 miles off the coast of Plymouth. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Right, we need to select a missile. 
MICKEY: We can't go nuclear, we don't have the defense codes. 
NINTH DOCTOR: We don't need it, all we need is an ordinary missile. What's the first category?
MICKEY: Sub Haffoon, UGMA4A. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's the one. Select. 
JACKIE: I could stop you. 
MICKEY: Do it, then. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Ready for this? 
MICKEY: Yeah. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Mickey the Idiot. The world is in your hands. Fire. 
JACKIE: Oh, my God. 
HARRIET: How solid are these?
NINTH DOCTOR: Not solid enough, built for short range attack, nothing this big. 
ROSE: Alright. Now I'm making the decision. I'm not gonna die, we're gonna ride this one out. 
ROSE: It's like what they say about earthquakes, you can survive 'em by standing under a doorframe. Now this cupboard's small so it's strong. Come and help me! Come on!
NEW YORK NEWSREADER: The vote is in. The counsel says... yes. They are releasing the codes. 
JOSEPH: Ring, damn you!
MICKEY: It's on radar. Counter defense 556. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Stop them intercepting it. 
MICKEY: I'm doing it now. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Good boy.
MICKEY: 556 neutralized. 
SERGEANT: What do you mean, 'incoming'? 
SERGEANT: Everybody out! Now! Get out!
JOSEPH: What the hell is that for? 
SERGEANT: Sir, there's a missile!
SERGEANT: ... Sorry. 
SLITHEEN 1: That's mine!
SLITHEEN 2: No, mine!
SERGEANT: Everybody run!
HARRIET: Nice knowing you both. 
HARRIET: Hannibal!
SLITHEEN: Oh, boll--
HARRIET: Made in Britain. 
SERGEANT: Are you alright?
HARRIET: Harriet Jones. MP, Flydale North. I want you to contact UN immediately, tell the ambassadors the crisis is over and they can step down. Go on, tell the news!
SERGEANT: Yes, ma'am. 
HARRIET: Someone's got a hell of a job sorting this lot out. Oh, Lord! We haven't even got a Prime Minister!
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, maybe you should have a go. 
HARRIET: Me?
HARRIET: I'm only a back-bencher. 
ROSE: I'd vote for ya!
HARRIET: Now, don't be silly. 
HARRIET: Look, I'd better go and see if I can help. 
HARRIET: Hang on! 
HARRIET: The Earth is safe! Sergeant!
NINTH DOCTOR: I thought I knew the name. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Harriet Jones - future Prime Minister. Elected for three successive terms - the architect of Britain's Golden Age. 
HARRIET: The crisis has passed! Ladies and Gentlemen - I have something to say to you all!
HARRIET: Mankind stands tall - proud - and undefeated. God bless the human race.
HARRIET: Mankind stands tall - proud -
JACKIE: Harriet Jones. Who does she think she is? Look at her! Taking all the credit. Should be you on there.
JACKIE: My daughter saved the world! 
ROSE: I think the Doctor helped a bit...
JACKIE: Oh, alright then. Him too. You should be given knighthoods. 
ROSE: That's not the way he does things. No fuss, he just... moves on. He's not that bad if you gave him a chance. 
JACKIE: He's good in a crisis, I'll give him that.
ROSE: Oh! Now the world has changed, you're saying nice things about him. 
JACKIE: Well, I reckon I've got no choice! There's no getting rid of him since you're infatuated. 
ROSE: I'm not infatuated...
JACKIE: What does he eat?
ROSE: How do you mean?
JACKIE: I was gonna do shepherds pie. 
JACKIE: All of us. A proper sit down. 'Cause... I'm ready to listen. I wanna learn about you and him and that life you lead. Only, I dunno, he's an alien. For all I know, he eats grass and safety pins and things. 
ROSE: He'll have shepherds pie. You're gonna cook for him?
JACKIE: What's wrong with that?
ROSE: He's finally met his match. 
JACKIE: You're not too old for a slap, you know. 
JACKIE: You can go and visit your gran tomorrow. 
JACKIE: You'd better learn some French. I told her you were in France. I said you were au-pairing.
ROSE: Hello?
NINTH DOCTOR: Right, I'll be a couple of hours, then we can go. 
ROSE: You've got a phone?
NINTH DOCTOR: You think I can travel through space and time and I haven't got a phone? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Like I said, couple of hours... I've just got to send out this dispersal.. 
NINTH DOCTOR: There you go. That's canceling out the Slitheen's advert in case any bargain hunters turn up. 
ROSE: My mother's cooking.
NINTH DOCTOR: Good! Put her on a slow heat and let her simmer. 
ROSE: She's cooking tea. For us. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't do that.
ROSE: She wants to get to know you.
NINTH DOCTOR: Tough! I've got better things to do!
ROSE: It's just tea. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Not to me it isn't. 
ROSE: She's my mother.
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, she's not mine!
ROSE: That's not fair! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, you can stay there if you want! 
NINTH DOCTOR: But right now there's this plasma storm brewing in the horse head nebula. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Fires are burning 10 million miles wide. I could fly the TARDIS right into the heart of it then ride the shock wave all the way out - hurtle right across the sky and end up anywhere. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Your choice. 
JACKIE: Rose, I was thinking...
JACKIE: I've got that bottle of Amaretto from New Years Eve, does he drink?
JACKIE: I was wondering whether he drinks or not.
ROSE: Yeah, he does.
JACKIE: Don't go, sweetheart. 
JACKIE: Please don't go. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Good lad. Graffiti that again and I'll 'ave ya. Now, beat it. 
MICKEY: I just went down the shop. And I was thinking, you know, like the whole world's changed. Aliens and spaceships all in public. And here it is.
MICKEY: How could they do that? They saw it!
NINTH DOCTOR: They're just not ready. You're happy to believe in something that's invisible, but if it's staring you in the face - nope! Can't see it! There's a scientific explanation for that. You're thick. 
MICKEY: We're just idiots.
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, not all of you. 
MICKEY: Yeah?
NINTH DOCTOR: Present for you, Mickey. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's a virus. Put it online, it'll destroy every mention of me. I'll cease to exist.
MICKEY: What do you want to do that for?
NINTH DOCTOR: 'Cause you're right. I am dangerous. I don't want anybody following me.
MICKEY: How can you say that - and then take her with you?
NINTH DOCTOR: You could look after her. Come with us. 
MICKEY: I can't. This life of yours... it's just too much, I... I couldn't do it. 
MICKEY: Don't tell her I said that. 
JACKIE: I'll get a proper job. I'll work weekends, I'll pass my test and if Jim comes round again, I'll say no. I really will. 
ROSE: I'm not leaving 'cause of you. I'm traveling, that's all. And then I'll come back!
JACKIE: But it's not safe.
ROSE: Mum... if you saw it out there... you'd never stay home. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Got enough stuff? 
ROSE: Last time I stepped in there, it was spur of the moment.
ROSE: Now I'm signing up. You're stuck with me. Haha. 
ROSE: Come with us. There's plenty of room. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No chance, he's ah, a liability, I'm not having him on board. 
ROSE: We'd be dead without him. 
NINTH DOCTOR: My decision is final. 
ROSE: Sorry. 
MICKEY: Good luck, then. 
JACKIE: You still can't promise me. What if she gets lost? What if something happens to you, Doctor, and she's left all alone standing on some moon a million light years away - how long do I wait then?
ROSE: Mum...
ROSE: You're forgetting - it's a time machine. I could go traveling around suns and planets and all the way out to the edge of the universe and by the time I get back, yeah - ten seconds would have passed. Just ten seconds.
ROSE: So stop worrying. See you in ten seconds time. Hmm?
JACKIE: Ten seconds.
