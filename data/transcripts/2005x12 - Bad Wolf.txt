NINTH DOCTOR: What is it? What's happening?
LYNDA: Oh my God!
LYNDA: I don't BELIEVE it! Why'd they put you in there?? They never said you were coming!
NINTH DOCTOR: But what happened? I was... 
LYNDA: Careful now... oh! 
LYNDA: Oh! Mind yourself! Oh, that's the transmat. Scrambles your head - I was sick for days.
LYNDA: You all right?
LYNDA: So! What's your name then, sweetheart?
NINTH DOCTOR: The Doctor, I think. I was er... I don't know, what happened? How--
LYNDA: You got chosen.
NINTH DOCTOR: Chosen for what?
LYNDA: You're a house mate. You're in the house! Isn't that brilliant?!
STROOD: That's not fair.
STROOD: We've got eviction in five minutes! I've been here for all nine weeks, I've followed the rules, I haven't had a single warning, and then he comes swanning in.
CROSBIE: If they keep changing the rules, I'm gonna protest, I am. You just watch me, I'm - I'm gonna paint the walls.
BIG BROTHER: Would the Doctor please come to the Diary Room?
BIG BROTHER: You are live on channel forty-four-thousand. Please do not swear.
NINTH DOCTOR: You have GOT to be kidding.
ROSE: What happened?
RODERICK: It's all right... it's the transmat. Does your head in. 
RODERICK: Get a bit of amnesia. What's your name?
ROSE: Rose. But... where's the Doctor?
RODERICK: Just remember - do what the Android says. Don't provoke it. The Android's word is law.
ROSE: What d'you mean, android? Like... a robot?
FLOOR MANAGER: Positions, everyone! Thank you!
RODERICK: Come on. Hurry up! Steady, steady...
ROSE: I was traveling. With the Doctor and a man called Captain Jack...? The Doctor wouldn't just leave me...
FLOOR MANAGER: That's enough chat! Positions! Final call! 
FLOOR MANAGER: Good luck!
ROSE: But I'm not supposed to be here.
RODERICK: Well, it says Rose on the podium...
RODERICK: Come on!
ROSE: Hold on... I must be going mad. 
ROSE: It can't be. This looks like the--
FLOOR MANAGER: Android activated! 
ROSE: Oh, my God. The Android. The Anne... Droid. 
ANNE DROID: Welcome, to 'The Weakest Link'! 
TRIN-E: Here we go again. We've got our work cut out for us. 
ZU-ZANA: I don't know - he's sort of handsome. That's a good lantern jaw.
TRIN-E: Lantern jaws are so last year. 
JACK: Sorry… nice to meet you ladies, but where exactly am I?
TRIN-E: We're giving you a brand-new image. 
JACK: Oh, hold on, I was with the Doctor-
JACK: Why, is there something wrong with what I'm wearing? 
ZU-ZANA: It's all very twentieth century - where DID you get that denim?
JACK: Little place in Cardiff... it was called 'The Top Shop'. 
ZU-ZANA: Oh - design classic. 
TRIN-E: But we're gonna have to find you some new colours. Maybe get rid of that 'Oklahoma Farm Boy' thing you've got going on...
ZU-ZANA: Just stand still and let the Defabricator work its magic. 
JACK: What's the Defabricator? 
JACK: Okay... Defabricator. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Am I naked in front of millions of viewers? 
TRIN-E: Absolutely!
ZU-ZANA: Absolutely!
JACK: Ladies... your viewing figures just went up. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I can't open it. 
LYNDA: It's got a deadlock seal. Ever since Big Brother Five Hundred and Four when they all walked out...? 
LYNDA: You MUST remember that. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What about this?
LYNDA: Oh, that's exoglass. You'd need a nuclear bomb to get through. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't tempt me. 
LYNDA: I know you're not supposed to talk about the outside world, but you must've been watching. Do people like me? Lynda with a Y, not Linda with an I - she got forcibly evicted because she damaged the camera. 
LYNDA: Am I popular? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't remember. 
LYNDA: Oh, but does that mean I'm nothing? Some people get this far just 'cos they're insignificant. Doesn't anybody notice me? 
NINTH DOCTOR: No... you're... you're nice. You're sweet. Everybody thinks you're sweet. 
LYNDA: Oh! Is that right? Is that what I am? Oh, no-one's ever told me that before. Am I sweet? Really?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah. Dead sweet!
LYNDA: Thank you! 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's just a wall - isn't there supposed to be a garden out there? 
LYNDA: Don't be daft. No-one's got a garden anymore. Who's got a garden? Don't tell me YOU'VE got a garden!
NINTH DOCTOR: No, I've just got the TARDIS... I remember. 
LYNDA: That's the amnesia! So what happened? Where did they get you?
NINTH DOCTOR: We'd just left Raxacoriofallapatorius. Then we went to Kyoto, that's right. Japan in 1336, and we only just escaped...
NINTH DOCTOR: We were together, we were laughing, and then... there was this light...
NINTH DOCTOR: ... this white light coming through the walls, and then...
NINTH DOCTOR: And then I woke up here. 
LYNDA: Yeah, that's the transmat beam. That's how they pick the housemates. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, Lynda with a Y... sweet little Lynda... It's worse than that.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm not just a passing traveller. No stupid little transmat gets inside my ship. That beam was fifteen million times more powerful, which means... this isn't just a game. There's something else going on. Well! Here's the latest update from the Big Brother house. I'm getting out. I'm gonna find my friends. And then I'm gonna find YOU. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Need a word.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Hold on... let me finish this. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: 19... 18... 
FLOOR MANAGER: 17... 16... 15... thank you people, transmitting in 12... 11... 10... 
ROSE: But I need to find the Doc--
RODERICK: Just-- shut up and play the game!
ROSE: All right then. What the hell? I'm gonna play to win!
FLOOR MANAGER: 3, and cue!
ANNE DROID: Let's play 'The Weakest Link'!
ANNE DROID: Start the clock.
ANNE DROID: Agorax - the name of which basic food stuff is an anagram of the word 'beard'?
AGORAX: Bread.
ANNE DROID: Correct. Fitch - in the Pan Traffic Calendar, which month comes after Hoob?
FITCH: Is it... Clavadoe?
ANNE DROID: No, Pandoff. Rose, in maths, what is 258 minus 158?
ROSE: One hundred!
ANNE DROID: Correct. Roderick -
RODERICK: Bank. 
ANNE DROID: Which letter of the alphabet appears in the word 'dangle' but not in the word 'gland'?
RODERICK: E.
ANNE DROID: Correct! Colleen - in social security, what D is the name of the payment given to Martian Drones?
COLLEEN: Default.
ANNE DROID: Correct. Broff - the Great Cobalt Pyramid is built on the remains of which famous Old Earth Institute?
BROFF: T-- Touchdown.
ANNE DROID: No - Torchwood.
ANNE DROID: Agorax - in language, all five examples of which type of letter appear in the word 'facetious'?
AGORAX: Vowels.
ANNE DROID: Correct. Fitch - in biology, which blood cells contain iron - red or white?
FITCH: Um... white.
ANNE DROID: No, red. Rose - in the holovid series 'Jupiter Rising', the Grexnik is married to whom?
ROSE: How should I know?
ANNE DROID: No, the correct answer is Lord Drayvole.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Why's she laughing?
ANNE DROID: Roderick - in maths, what is nine squared?
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Oh, my God... I don't think she knows...
MALE PROGRAMMER: And I've got a housemate to appear out of nowhere. I told you - it's like the game's running itself.
TRIN-E: It's the buccaneer look. Little dash of pirate and just a tweak of President Schwarzenegger. 
JACK: Nah, not sure about the vest. What about a little bit of colour to lift it? 
ZU-ZANA: Absolutely not. Never wear black with colour. It makes the colour look cheap and the black look boring. Now, let's talk jackets.
JACK: I kinda like the first one...
ZU-ZANA: No, that's a bit too much Hell's Angel. I think I like the shorter one.
ZU-ZANA: Look, waist length, nice and slimming, shows off the bum.
JACK: Works for me. 
TRIN-E: Once we've got an outfit, we can look at the face. Ever thought about cosmetic surgery? 
JACK: Well, I've considered it, yeah. A little lift around the eyes... tighten up the jaw line... what do you think?
TRIN-E: Oh, let's have a BIT more ambition... Let's do something... cutting edge.
ANNE DROID: So, Rose. What do you actually do?
ROSE: I just travel about a bit. Bit of a... tourist, I suppose.  
ANNE DROID: Another way of saying 'unemployed'. 
ROSE: No. 
ANNE DROID: Have you got a job?
ROSE: Well... not really, no, but--
ANNE DROID: Then you ARE unemployed! And yet, you've STILL got enough money to buy peroxide. Why Fitch?
ROSE: Uh... I think she got a few of the questions wrong. 
ROSE: ... that's all. 
ANNE DROID: Oh, you'd know all about that. 
ROSE: Well yeah,  but I can't vote for myself, so it had to be Fitch... 
ROSE: I'm sorry... that's the game. That's how it works... I had to vote for someone.
FITCH: Let me try again, it was the lights and everything - I couldn't think. 
ANNE DROID: In fact, with three answers wrong, Broff was the weakest link in that round, but - it's votes that count. 
FITCH: I'm sorry. Oh, please... oh God, help me!
ANNE DROID: Fitch - you are the weakest link. Goodbye!
FLOOR MANAGER: And we've gone to the adverts. Back in three minutes...
ROSE: Wassat? What's just happened?
RODERICK: She was the weakest link - she gets disintegrated.
RODERICK: Blasted into atoms. 
ROSE: But I voted for her. Oh, my God. This is sick.
ROSE: All of ya, you're just sick! I'm not playing this--
BROFF: I'm not playing! I... I can't do it.
BROFF: I'm not-- please, somebody let me--
ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link.
ANNE DROID: Goodbye.
RODERICK: Don't try to escape. It's play... or die.
LYNDA: Doctor, they said ALL the housemates must gather on the sofa. You've got to. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Busy getting out, thanks.
LYNDA: But if you don't obey, then ALL the housemates get punished. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well maybe I'll be voted out, then. 
STROOD: How stupid are you? You've only just joined, you're not eligible.
LYNDA: Don't try anything clever or we all get it in the neck.
BIG BROTHER: Big Brother House - this is Davina Droid.
BIG BROTHER: Crosbie, Lynda and Strood - you have all been nominated for eviction.
BIG BROTHER: And the eighth person to be evicted from the Big Brother House is...
BIG BROTHER: ... Crosbie!
LYNDA: I'm sorry! Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!
STROOD: Oh, it should've been me, that's not fair... oh, Crosbie love...
BIG BROTHER: Crosbie, you have ten seconds to make your farewells, and then we're gonna get you!
LYNDA: I won't forget you.
CROSBIE: I'm sorry I stole your soap.
LYNDA: Oh, I don't mind, honestly.
STROOD: Thanks for the food, you're a smashing cook. Bless you.
BIG BROTHER: Crosbie, please leave the Big Brother House.
CROSBIE: Bye, then... bye Lynda...
LYNDA: Bye…
LYNDA: I don't believe it. Poor Crosbie...
NINTH DOCTOR: It's only a game show, she'll make a fortune on the outside! Sell her story, release a record, fitness video, all of that... she'll be laughing!
LYNDA: What d'you mean, 'on the outside'? 
STROOD: Here we go... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, what are they waiting for? Why don't they just let her go? 
LYNDA: Stop it, it's not funny. 
BIG BROTHER: Eviction in... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1! 
NINTH DOCTOR: What was that? 
STROOD: Disintegrator beam. 
LYNDA: She's been evicted. From life. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: No one programmed the transmat, no one selected the new contestants... it is exactly like those stories.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Oh, don't start that again. I think you need to take a session off.
MALE PROGRAMMER: Well, I would. If you'd take it with me. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: And don't start that again either. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: But the rumours go back decades. Saying that something's been... hidden up here. Underneath the transmissions. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: But the Controller would know. She watches everything. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Maybe she just can't see it. Gotta allow for human error.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Well, that's your problem, then. I don't think she's been human for years.
CONTROLLER: 18... 19... 20... 21... 22... 23... transmit. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Are you INSANE? You just step right into the disintegrator? Is it that important, getting your face on the telly? Is it worth DYING for? 
LYNDA: You're talking like we've got a choice! 
NINTH DOCTOR: But I thought you had to apply! 
STROOD: Don't be so stupid. That's how they played it centuries back. 
LYNDA: You get chosen whether you like it or not! Everyone on Earth is a potential contestant. The transmat beam picks you out at random. And it's non-stop. There are sixty Big Brother houses running all at once. 
NINTH DOCTOR: How many? SIXTY?
STROOD: They've had to cut back. It's not what it was. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's a CHARNEL house! What about the winners? What do they get? 
LYNDA: They get to live.
NINTH DOCTOR: Is that it?!
LYNDA: Well, isn't that enough?!
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose is out there. She got caught in the transmat. She's a contestant. Time I got out. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That other contestant - Lynda with an I - she was forcibly evicted for what?
LYNDA: Damaged property...
NINTH DOCTOR: What, like this?
JACK: No. I'm just not getting this. It just too safe - too decent. And you'd never keep it clean.
ZU-ZANA: Stage Two ready and waiting! 
JACK: Bring it on, girls!
TRIN-E: And now it's time for the face-off!
JACK: What does that mean? Do I get to compete with someone else? 
TRIN-E: No, like I said - face... off!
ZU-ZANA: I think you'd look good with a dog's head.
TRIN-E: Or maybe no head at all. That would be so outrageous. 
ZU-ZANA: And we could stitch your legs to the middle of your chest. 
TRIN-E: Nothing is too extreme. It's to die for. 
JACK: Now, hold on, ladies. I don't want to have to shoot either one of you. 
TRIN-E: But you're unarmed!
ZU-ZANA: You're naked! 
ZU-ZANA: But... that's a Compact Laser Deluxe! 
TRIN-E: WHERE were you hiding that? 
JACK: You really don't wanna know. 
TRIN-E: Give me that accessory--
ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link. Goodbye!
FLOOR MANAGER: Going to the break! Two minutes on the clock. 
FLOOR MANAGER: Just a reminder - we've got solar flare activity coming up in ten.
ROSE: Colleen was clever, she banked all our money. Why'd you vote for her? 
RODERICK: 'Cos I want to keep you in! You're stupid! You don't even know the Princess Vossaheen's surname. When it comes to the final, I want to be up against you. So that you get disintegrated, and I get a stack-load of credits. Courtesy of the Bad Wolf Corporation...
ROSE: What d'you mean? Who's Bad Wolf? 
RODERICK: They're in charge. They run the Game Station. 
ROSE: Why are they called Bad Wolf? 
RODERICK: I dunno, it's just a name. It's like an Old Earth... nursery rhyme sort of thing-- what does it matter?
ROSE: I keep hearing those words everywhere we go. Bad Wolf. 
GWYNETH: The things you've seen... the darkness... the big bad wolf--
TANNOY VOICE: Attention all personnel - Bad Wolf One descending.
NINTH DOCTOR: Blaidd Drwg... 
ROSE: What's it mean?
NINTH DOCTOR: Bad Wolf.
ROSE: Different times... different places like it's written all over the universe... 
RODERICK: What're you going on about?
ROSE: If the Bad Wolf is in charge of this quiz, then... maybe I'm not here by mistake. Someone's been planning this...
BIG BROTHER: The Doctor - you've broken the House Rules. 
BIG BROTHER: Big Brother has no choice but to evict you. 
BIG BROTHER: You have ten seconds to make your farewells, and then we're gonna get you!
NINTH DOCTOR: That's more like it! Come on then, open up! 
LYNDA: You're mad! It's like you WANT to die! 
STROOD: I reckon he's a plant! He was only brought in to stir things up! 
BIG BROTHER: The Doctor - please leave the Big Brother house. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on then, disintegrate me! Come on, what're you waiting for?
LYNDA: He is, he's mad. He's bonkers. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Disintegrate me!
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: I told you to keep an eye on him, not KILL him. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: He damaged the property. It's an automatic process. 
BIG BROTHER: Eviction in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
NINTH DOCTOR: Haha!
NINTH DOCTOR: I knew it! You see? Someone BROUGHT me into this game. If they'd wanted me dead, they could've transmatted me into a volcano. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: What did you do?
MALE PROGRAMMER: Nothing! 
NINTH DOCTOR: They want me alive--
MALE PROGRAMMER: It's like... some sort of override. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Maybe the security isn't as tight this end. Are you following this? I'm getting out! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Come with me.
STROOD: We're not allowed!
NINTH DOCTOR: Stay in there - you've got a fifty-fifty chance of disintegration. Stay with me - I promise I'll get you out alive. Come on!
LYNDA: No-- I can't, I can't... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Lynda, you're sweet. From what I've seen of your world, d'you think anyone votes for sweet? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Hold on... I've been here before. This is Satellite Five!
NINTH DOCTOR: No guards. That makes a change. You'd think a big business like Satellite Five would be armed to the teeth. 
LYNDA: No one's called it Satellite Five in ages. It's the Game Station now. Hasn't been Satellite Five in about a hundred years. 
NINTH DOCTOR: A hundred years exactly. It's the year two zero-zero/one zero-zero. I was here before. Floor 139. Satellite was broadcasting news channels back then... had a bit of trouble upstairs. Nothing too serious. Easy - gave 'em a hand - home in time for tea.
LYNDA: A hundred years ago? 
LYNDA: What, you were here a hundred years ago? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yep! 
LYNDA: You're looking good on it... 
NINTH DOCTOR: I moisturise. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Funny sorts of readings. All kinds of energy... the place is humming. It's weird. This goes way beyond normal transmissions. What would they need all that power for? 
LYNDA: I dunno. I think we're the first ever contestants to get outside. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I had two friends traveling with me. They must've got caught in the same transmat. Where would they be?
LYNDA: I dunno. They could've been allocated anywhere. There's a hundred different games. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Like what? 
LYNDA: Well, there's ten floors of 'Big Brother'. There's a different House behind each of those doors. And then beyond that, there's all sorts of shows. It's non-stop. There's um... 'Call My Bluff'... with real guns... 'Countdown', where you've got thirty seconds to stop the bomb going off... 'Ground Force', which is a nasty one... you get turned into compost. Erm... 'Wipeout', speaks for itself... oh! And 'Stars In Their Eyes'. Literally, stars in their eyes. If you don't sing, you get blinded. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And you watch this stuff? 
LYNDA: Everyone does. How come you don't? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Never paid for my license. 
LYNDA: Oh, my God! You get executed for that! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Let them try. 
LYNDA: You keep saying things that don't make sense. But who are you though, Doctor? Really? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. 
LYNDA: Well, it does to me... I've just put my life in your hands. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm just a traveller, wandering past. Believe it or not, all I'm after is a quiet life. 
LYNDA: So... if we get out of here, what're you gonna do? Just... wander off again? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Fast as I can.
LYNDA: So... I could come with ya. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Maybe you could. 
LYNDA: I wouldn't get in the way. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I wouldn't mind if you did. Not a bad idea, Lynda with a Y. 
NINTH DOCTOR: But first of all, we've gotta concentrate on the getting out. And to do that, you've got to know your enemy - who's controlling it - who's in charge of the satellite now? 
LYNDA: Hold on...
LYNDA: Your Lords and Masters. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Okay, you win. The Controller's got to handle this. The Archive makes a record of all transmat activities. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Find out how they got on board... Archive Six. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Controller… we have a problem. 
CONTROLLER: Continue working. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: We have a security problem. 
CONTROLLER: Continue working. 6... 5...
MALE PROGRAMMER: I'm sorry, but I can't. We have contestants outside of the games. But the alarms haven't gone off. 
CONTROLLER: No security. The games continue. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: But we can't just let them wander... 
CONTROLLER: They are no one. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: They are no one. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Erm... sorry. I was just, um...
CONTROLLER: Archive Six is out of bounds. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: But I need to check the transmat log. 
CONTROLLER: Archive Six is out of bounds. No one may enter Archive Six. Return to work. Return to work. Inform all staff - solar flares in delta point seven. 19... 20...
JACK: Compatible systems... just align the wave signature... Thattaboy! Got myself a gun. Well, ladies, the pleasure was all mine. Which is the only thing that matters in the end.
JACK: Two hearts, that's him... which floor?
LYNDA: Blimey! I've never seen it for real before! Not... not from orbit. Planet Earth...
NINTH DOCTOR: What's happened to it?  
LYNDA: Well, it's always been like that. Ever since I was born. See that there? That's the Great Atlantic Smog Storm. It's been going twenty years. We get newsflashes telling us when it's safe to breathe outside. 
NINTH DOCTOR: So, the population just sits there? Half the world's too fat, half the world's too thin, and you lot just watch telly? 
LYNDA: Ten thousand channels, all beaming down from here. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The Human Race. Brainless sheep. Being fed on a diet of... mind you, have they still got that programme where three people have to live with a bear? 
LYNDA: Oh, 'Bear With Me', I LOVE that one! 
NINTH DOCTOR: And me. The celebrity edition where the bear got in the--
LYNDA: Got in the bath!
NINTH DOCTOR: But it's all gone wrong. I mean, HISTORY'S gone wrong. Again. This should be the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire - I don't understand. Last time I was here, I put it right. 
LYNDA: No, but that's when it first went wrong. A hundred years ago, like you said. All the news channels - they just shut down overnight. 
NINTH DOCTOR: But that was me. I did that. 
LYNDA: There was nothing left in their place. No information. The whole planet just froze. The government - the economy - they collapsed... that was the start of it. One hundred years of hell. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, my... I made this world. 
ANNE DROID: That leaves Rose and Roderick - you're going head-to-head... let's play 'The Weakest Link'. 
RODERICK: Right, that's the end of tactical voting... you're on your own now. 
JACK: Hey, handsome! Good to see ya! Any sign of Rose? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Can't you track her down? 
JACK: She must still be inside the games. All the rooms are shielded. 
NINTH DOCTOR: If we can just get inside this computer... she's GOT to be here somewhere. 
JACK: Well, you'd better hurry up. These games don't have a happy ending. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You think I don't know that? 
JACK: There you go. 
JACK: Patch that in. It's programmed to find her. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Thanks.
JACK: Hey there!
LYNDA: Hello! 
JACK: Captain Jack Harkness. 
LYNDA: Lynda Moss. 
JACK: Nice to meet you, Lynda Moss!
NINTH DOCTOR: D'you mind flirting outside?
JACK: I was just saying hello! 
NINTH DOCTOR: For you, that's flirting. 
LYNDA: I'm not complaining. 
JACK: Which is a good idea. 
LYNDA: Oh!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not compatible. This stupid system doesn't make sense. 
NINTH DOCTOR: This place should be a basic broadcaster. The systems are twice as complicated. It's more than just television... this station's transmitting something else. 
JACK: Like what?
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't know. This whole Bad Wolf thing's tied up with me. Someone's manipulating my entire life. It's some sort of trap and Rose is stuck inside it. 
ANNE DROID: Rose, in geography, the Grand Central Ravine is named after which Ancient Britain City?
ROSE: Is it York? 
ANNE DROID: No, the correct answer is Sheffield. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Found her! Floor 407!
LYNDA: Oh, my God! She's with the Anne Droid! You've gotta get her out of there!

NINTH DOCTOR: Game Room Six, which one is it?!
LYNDA: Over here! 
RODERICK: San... Hazeldine. 
ANNE DROID: No...
ANNE DROID: ... the correct answer is San Chen. 
JACK: Stand back, let me blast it open. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Can't, it's made of Hydra Combination. 
ANNE DROID: Rose, in history, which Icelandic city hosted Murder Spree Twenty?
ROSE: Reykjavik…?
ANNE DROID: No, the correct answer is Pola Ventura. 
RODERICK: Oh, my God! I've done it! You've lost! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on, come on, come on... 
ROSE: But I'm not meant to be here. I need to find the Doctor, he's got to be here somewhere-- he's always here! He wouldn't just leave me! 
ANNE DROID: Roderick, you are the strongest link, you will be transported home with one thousand six hundred credits.
RODERICK: Oh, thank you, thank you so much. 
ROSE: This game is illegal! I'm telling you to stop! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose!
ANNE DROID: Rose, you leave this life with nothing--
JACK: Stop this game! 
NINTH DOCTOR: I order you to stop this game! 
FLOOR MANAGER: We're live on air!
ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link. 
ROSE: Look out for the Anne Droid, it's armed!
JACK: What the hell did you do to her??
JACK: Back off! 
FLOOR MANAGER: I need security and I need it here right now! It's this lot... 
JACK: Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! 
JACK: You killed her! Your stupid freaking game show killed her. 
SECURITY GUARD: Sir, I'm arresting you under Private Legislation Sixteen of the Game Station Syndicate. 
SECURITY GUARD: Can you tell us the purpose of this device, sir? 
SECURITY GUARD: Can you tell us how you got on board? 
LYNDA: Just leave him alone--
SECURITY GUARD: I'm asking HIM.
SECURITY GUARD: Sir? Can you tell us who you are? 
SECURITY GUARD: You will be taken from this place to the Lunar Penal Colony, there to be held without trial, you may not appeal against this sentence. 
SECURITY GUARD: Is that understood? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Let's do it. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Oh, my God. Now we're in trouble. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Floor 500. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Clear the floor! He's on his way up here. With a gun! 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: This is an emergency! You've got to close the lift!
CONTROLLER: All staff are reminded that solar flares commence in delta point two-
MALE PROGRAMMER: Never mind solar flares! He's gonna KILL you! 
JACK: Okay! Move away from the desk! Nobody try anything clever. Everybody clear!
JACK: Stand to the sides. And stay there. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Who's in charge of this place? 
CONTROLLER: ... 18... 19... 20... 
NINTH DOCTOR: This Satellite's more than a Game Station.
CONTROLLER: 79... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Who killed Rose Tyler? 
CONTROLLER: All staff are reminded that solar flares--
NINTH DOCTOR: I want an answer! 
CONTROLLER: ... in delta point one. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: She can't reply.
MALE PROGRAMMER: Don't shoot! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, don't be so thick. Like I was ever gonna shoot. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Captain, we've got more guards on the way up. Secure the exits. 
JACK: Yes, sir! 
NINTH DOCTOR: You - what were you saying?
MALE PROGRAMMER: But... I've got your gun. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay, so shoot me. Why can't she answer? 
MALE PROGRAMMER: She's, um... Can I put this down? 
NINTH DOCTOR: If you want, just hurry up. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Thanks. Sorry. Um... the Controller is linked to the transmissions. The entire output goes through her brain - you're not a member of staff so she doesn't recognize your existence.
NINTH DOCTOR: What's her name?
MALE PROGRAMMER: I don't know. She was installed when she was five years old. That's the only life she's ever known.
JACK: Door's sealed. We should be safe for about ten minutes. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Keep an eye on 'em.
MALE PROGRAMMER: But that stuff you were saying about something going on with the Game Station - I think you're right. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Unauthorized transmats... it's been going on for years. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Show me.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: You're not allowed in there! Archive Six is out of bounds! 
JACK: Do I look like an out-of-bounds sort of guy?
JACK: What the hell...? 
CONTROLLER: Solar-flare activity at delta point zero...
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: If you're not holding us hostage, then open the door and let us out. The staff are terrified. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's the same staff who execute hundreds of contestants every day--
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: That's not our fault, we're just doing our jobs.
NINTH DOCTOR: And with that sentence, you just lost the right to even talk to me. Now back off. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: That's just the solar-flares. They interfere with the broadcast signal, so this place automatically powers down. Planet Earth gets a few repeats. It's all quite normal.
CONTROLLER: Doctor...
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Doctor?
NINTH DOCTOR: Whatever it is, you can wait.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: I think she wants you. 
CONTROLLER: Doctor... 
CONTROLLER: Doctor...? Where's the Doctor? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm here.
CONTROLLER: Can't see. I'm blind. So blind. All my life, blind. All I can see is numbers, but I saw you. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What do you want?
CONTROLLER: Solar-flares hiding me. They can't hear me-- my-- my masters, they always listen but they can't hear me now. The sun... the sun is so bright... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Who are your masters?
CONTROLLER: They wired my head, their name is forbidden. They control my thoughts, my masters... my masters, I had to be careful. They monitor the transmissions but they don't watch the programmes. I could hide you inside the games.
NINTH DOCTOR: My friend died inside your games. 
CONTROLLER: Doesn't matter.
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't you DARE tell me that. 
CONTROLLER: They've been hiding. My masters, hiding in the dark space, watching and shaping the Earth... so, so, so many years... they've always been there. Guiding humanity, hundreds and hundred of years--
NINTH DOCTOR: Who are they? 
CONTROLLER: They wait. They plan and grow in numbers, they're strong now. So strong, my masters--
NINTH DOCTOR: Who are they? 
CONTROLLER: But they speak of you. My masters, they fear the Doctor.
NINTH DOCTOR: Tell me! Who are they?
CONTROLLER: 20... 21... 22...
NINTH DOCTOR: When's the next solar-flare? 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Two years time.
NINTH DOCTOR: Fat lot of good that is. 
JACK: Found the TARDIS! 
NINTH DOCTOR: We're not leaving now. 
JACK: No. But the TARDIS worked it out. 
JACK: You'll wanna watch this. 
JACK: Lynda, could you stand over there for me please?
LYNDA: I-- I just wanna go home.
JACK: It'll only take a second. Could you stand in that spot, quick as you can? 
JACK: Everybody watching? Okay... three, two, one-- 
NINTH DOCTOR: But you killed her!
JACK: Oh, d'you think?  
LYNDA: ... What the hell was that? 
JACK: It's a transmat beam. Not a disintegrator - a secondary transmat system. 
JACK: People don't get killed in the games! They get transported across space! Doctor, Rose is still alive!
ROSE: It can't be...
ROSE: But you're dead... I saw you die! 
NINTH DOCTOR: She's out there somewhere! 
CONTROLLER: Doctor! 
CONTROLLER: Co-ordinates five point six point one--
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't! The solar flare's gone, they'll hear you! 
CONTROLLER: Point four three four-- no my masters, no! I defy you! Sigma seven seven--
She screams. The Doctor looks up, and the wires she was attached to fall away, empty. There's nothing left but dust.
NINTH DOCTOR: They took her. 
CONTROLLER: Oh, my masters...
CONTROLLER: You can kill me. For I have brought your destruction. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Look, use that. It might contain the final numbers. I kept a log of all the unscheduled transmissions. 
JACK: Nice... thanks... Captain Jack Harkness, by the way... 
MALE PROGRAMMER: I'm Davitch Pavale. 
JACK: Nice to meet you, Davitch Pavale... 
NINTH DOCTOR: There's a time and a place. 
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: Are you saying this entire set-up's been a disguise all along? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Going way back. Installing the Jagrafess a hundred years ago. Someone's been playing a long game. Controlling the Human Race from behind the scenes for generations. 
JACK: Click on this. 
JACK: The transmat delivers to that point. Right on the edge of the solar system.
FEMALE PROGRAMMER: There's nothing there. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It looks like nothing. 'Cause that's what this satellite does. Underneath the transmission, there's another signal...
MALE PROGRAMMER: Doing what? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Hiding whatever's out there. Hiding it from sonar, radar, scanner... 
NINTH DOCTOR: There's something sitting right on top of Planet Earth... but it's completely invisible. 
NINTH DOCTOR: If I cancel the signal... 
JACK: That's impossible. I know those ships... they were destroyed. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Obviously, they survived. 
LYNDA: Who did? Who are they? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Two hundred ships. More than two thousand on board each one. That's just about half a million of them. 
MALE PROGRAMMER: Half a million what?
NINTH DOCTOR: Daleks. 
DALEK: Alert! Alert! We are detected! 
DALEK: It is the Doctor! He has located us!
DALEK: Open communications channel! 
DALEK: The female will stand. Stand! 
DALEK: I will talk to the Doctor. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, will you? That's nice. Hello!
DALEK: The Dalek Stratagem nears completion. The Fleet is almost ready. You will not intervene. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, really? Why's that then? 
DALEK: We have your associate. You will obey or she will be exterminated. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No. 
DALEK: Explain yourself. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I said 'no'. 
DALEK: What is the meaning of this negative?
NINTH DOCTOR: It means 'no'. 
DALEK: But she will be destroyed. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No! 'Cos this is what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna rescue her. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm gonna save Rose Tyler from the middle of the Dalek Fleet, and then I'm gonna save the Earth, and then just to finish off, I'm gonna wipe every last STINKING Dalek outta the sky! 
DALEK: But you have no weapons! No defences! No plan! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah. And doesn't that scare you to death? Rose?
ROSE: Yes, Doctor? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm coming to get you. 
DALEK: The Doctor is initiating hostile action!
DALEK: The Stratagem must advance. Begin the invasion of Earth!
DALEK: The Doctor will be exterminated!
DALEK: Exterminate!
DALEK: Exterminate!
DALEK: Exterminate!
