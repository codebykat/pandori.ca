ROSE: Peter Alan Tyler - my dad. The most wonderful man in the world. Born 15th of September 1954.
JACKIE: Come here, Rose. Come here...
JACKIE: Who's that? It's your Daddy. You weren't old enough to remember when he died. 1987. 7th of November. Do you remember what I told you? The day that Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clarke got married? 
JACKIE: He was always having adventures. Oh, he would have loved to have seen you now.
ROSE: That's what mum always says. So, I was thinking... could we? Could we go and see my dad when he was still alive? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Where's this come from, all of a sudden? 
ROSE: All right then, if we can't, if it goes against the laws of time or something, then never mind, we'll just leave it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No, I can do anything. I'm just more worried about you. 
ROSE: I wanna see him.
NINTH DOCTOR: Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. 
REGISTRAR: I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Angela Suzette Prentiss...
PETE: I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Suzanne... Suzette... Anita... 
JACKIE: Oh, just carry on. It's good enough for Lady Di. 
ROSE: I thought he'd be taller. 
REGISTRAR: ...to be my lawful wedded wife, to love and to hold 'til death us do part.
JACKIE: He died so close to home. I wasn't there. Nobody was. It was a hit and run driver. Never found out who. He was dead when the ambulance got there.
JACKIE: I only wish there'd been SOMEONE there for him.
ROSE: I wanna be that someone. So he doesn't die alone.
NINTH DOCTOR: November the 7th?
ROSE: 1987.
ROSE: That's so weird. The day my father died... I thought it'd be all sort of grim and stormy, it's just an ordinary day.
NINTH DOCTOR: The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Are you sure about this?
ROSE: Yeah.
ROSE: This is it. Jordan Road. He was late. He'd been to get a wedding present - a vase. Mum always said, that stupid vase.
ROSE: He got out of his car...
ROSE: ... and crossed the road.
ROSE: Oh, God. This is it.
NINTH DOCTOR: Go to him. Quick. 
ROSE: It's too late now. 
ROSE: By the time the ambulance got there, he was dead. 
ROSE: He can't die on his own. 
ROSE: Can I try again? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Right. That's the first you and me. It's a very bad idea, two sets of us being here at the same time. Just be careful they don't see us. Wait 'til she runs off and he follows, then go to your dad. 
ROSE: Oh, God. This is it. 
ROSE: I can't do this. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You don't have to do anything you don't want to, but this is the last time we can be here.
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose! No! 
ROSE: I did it! I saved your life!
PETE: Blimey, did you see the speed of it? Did you get his number?
ROSE: I really did it. Oh, my God, look at you! You're alive! That car was gonna kill ya!
PETE: Well, give me some credit, I did see it coming. I wasn't gonna walk under it, was I?
ROSE: I'm Rose. 
PETE: That's a coincidence. That's my daughter's name. 
ROSE: That's a great name. Good choice, well done. 
PETE: Right, I'd better shift. I've got a wedding to go to. 
ROSE: Is that Sarah Clarke's wedding?
PETE: Yeah, are you going?
ROSE: ...Yeah. 
PETE: You and your boyfriend need a lift?
PETE: There we go. Sorry about the mess. If you want a cup of tea, the kitchen's just down there, milk's in the fridge... well, it would be, wouldn't it? Where else would you put the milk? Mind you, there's always the window sill outside. I always thought if someone invented a window sill with special compartments, you know, one for milk, one for yogurt... make a lot of money out of that. 
PETE: Sell it to students and things... I should write that down. Anyway, never mind that, excuse me...
ROSE: All the stuff mum kept. His stuff. She kept it all packed away in boxes in the cupboard, she used to show me when she'd had a bit to drink. 
ROSE: Here it is. On display. Where it SHOULD be. 
ROSE: Third prize at the bowling... first two got to go to Didcot.
ROSE: Health drinks. Tonics, mum used to call them. He made his money selling this Vitex stuff. He had all sorts of jobs. He's so clever. 
ROSE: Solar power. Mum said he was gonna do this. Now he can. 
ROSE: Okay, look... I'll tell him you're not my boyfriend. 
NINTH DOCTOR: When we met, I said 'travel with me in space'. You said no. Then I said 'time machine'.
ROSE: It wasn't some big plan. I just saw it happening and I thought... I can stop it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I did it again. I picked another STUPID ape. I should've known. It's not about showing you the universe - it never is. It's about the universe doing something for you.
ROSE: So it's okay when YOU go to other times, and YOU save people's lives - but not when it's me saving my dad. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, you don't. Two sets of us being there made that a vulnerable point. 
ROSE: But he's alive!
NINTH DOCTOR: My entire planet died. My whole family. Do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them? 
ROSE: But it's not like I've changed HISTORY. Not much, I mean... he's never gonna be a world leader, he's not gonna start World War Three or anything...
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose - there's a man alive in the world who wasn't alive before. An ordinary man, that's the most important thing in creation. The whole world's different because he's alive.
ROSE: What, would you rather him dead?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm not SAYING that--
ROSE: No, I get it! For once, YOU'RE not the most important man in my life. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Let's see how you get on without me, then, give me the key.
NINTH DOCTOR: The TARDIS key. If I'm so insignificant, give it me back.
ROSE: All right then, I will. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, you've got what you wanted so that's goodbye then. 
ROSE: You don't scare me. 
ROSE: I know how sad you are. You'll be back in a minute. Or you'll hang around outside the TARDIS waiting for me. 
ROSE: And I'll make you wait a long time!
PETE: Boyfriend trouble? 
PETE: Excuse me, do you mind? What're you tidying up for? 
ROSE: Sorry... force of habit. 
PETE: Listen, don't worry about him. Couples have rows all the time. 
ROSE: We're not a couple. Why does EVERYONE think we're a couple? I think he left me.
PETE: What, a pretty girl like you? If I was going out with you--
ROSE: Stop! Right there!
PETE: I was just saying...
ROSE: I know what you're saying, and we're not going there. At no point are we going anywhere NEAR there. You aren't even aware that THERE exists. 
ROSE: I don't even want to think about THERE, and believe me, neither do you. THERE... for you... is like... pfft, it's like the Bermuda Triangle.  
PETE: Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke. 
ROSE: Right, are we off? 
PETE: So, that wouldn't be a mixed signal at all.
ROSE: Absolutely not.
PETE: I'll take you back to the loony bin where you belong. Still, I'm sure I've met you somewhere before...
STUART: It's weird. 
SONNY: What?
STUART: There's so many people missing. Uncle Steven, Auntie Lyn... all the Baxters. Where are they? You don't think something's gone wrong?  
SONNY: Maybe it's a Godsend. Gives you time to think. You don't have to go through with it, not these days. Live in sin for a bit. 
STUART: Dad...
SONNY: In ten years time you'll turn round and say, "if only I could turn the clock back". Is it me or did it just get cold? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose! 
PETE: I met this bloke at the Horse's, and he's cutting me in on copyright. 
ROSE: But I thought you were a proper businessman and that...
PETE: I wish! Ah, I do a bit of this, a bit of that - a straight bloke.
ROSE: Right... so I must've heard wrong. So really you're a bit of a... a Del Boy? 
PETE: Oh, shoot me down in flames. You're not related to my wife by any chance, are you? 
ROSE: Oh, my God... she's gonna be at the wedding. 
PETE: What, Jackie? Do you know her?
ROSE: Sort of. 
PETE: What's she told you about me, then?
ROSE: She said she'd picked the most fantastic man in the world. 
PETE: Must be a different Jackie, then. She'd never say that. 
PETE: This stuff goes right over my head. 
ROSE: That's not out yet.
PETE: It's a good job and all. 
ROSE: I'm just gonna check my messages. 
PETE: How d'ya mean, messages? Is that a phone?
ROSE: Yeah...
VOICE: Watson - come here - we need you. Watson - come here - we need you.
VOICE: Watson - come here - we need you. 
SONNY: Half the guests haven't turned up. You're better off not being here, it's a disaster in the making. 
SONNY: No, in this case, 'knocked her up' IS a phrase I'd use. 
VOICE: Watson - come here - we need you. 
SONNY: Hello? Who is this? 
VOICE: Watson - come here - we ne--
STUART: Dad, get inside! We can't see the bride before the wedding, it's bad luck! 
SONNY: Bad luck when you MET her. I tell you - this day is cursed. 
BEV: Now, that's what I call a meringue.
SUZIE: Listen, do what Stan said and go round the block, 'cos there's people missing.
SARAH: How do you mean, missing? 
BEV: There's no Dave, no Sunita, no B...
SUZIE: There's no one from the Lamb and Flag...    
SARAH: Oh, my train's detached again, I KNEW I should've used velcro...
JACKIE: I'm here, stop your belly-aching. Take Rose a sec, will ya? 
BEV: Oh, in't she pretty? 
JACKIE: She's a little madam, that's what she is. 
JACKIE: Oh, I need more hands. Where's her useless article of a dad got to? 
ROSE: Dad!
PETE: It's that car! The same one as before!
PETE: It was right in front of us, where's it gone? You called me 'dad', what did you say that for? 
JACKIE: Oh, wonderful. Here he is, the accident waiting to happen. 
JACKIE: You'd be late for your own funeral and it nearly was! 
PETE: No damage done. 
JACKIE: And who's this?
JACKIE: What're YOU looking at with your mouth open?
ROSE: Your hair. 
JACKIE: What?!
ROSE: I've never seen it like--
ROSE: I mean... it's lovely, your hair's lovely. 
ROSE: And that baby you're holding...
ROSE: That would be... your baby... 
JACKIE: Another one of yours, is she?
PETE: She saved my life! 
JACKIE: Oh, that's a new one! What was it LAST time? 
PETE: I didn't even know her. She was a cloakroom attendant. I was helping her look for my ticket. There were three duffel coats all the same, somehow the rack collapsed. We were under all this stuff.
ROSE: Were you playing around?!
JACKIE: What's it got to do with YOU what he gets up to? 
ROSE: What DOES he get up to? 
JACKIE: YOU'D know. 
PETE: Oh, 'cos I'm that stupid. I play around and then bring her home to meet the missus. You silly cow...
JACKIE: But you ARE that stupid. 
PETE: Can we keep this stuff back home? Just for now?
JACKIE: What, with the rest of the rubbish?
JACKIE: You bring home cut-priced detergents, tonic water, Betamax tape and NONE of it works - I'm DROWNING in your rubbish.
JACKIE: What did he tell you? Did he say he's this big businessman, 'cos he's not. He's a failure. Born failure, that one. Rose needs a proper father--
PETE: Jackie, I'm making a living, it keeps us fed, don't it? 
ROSE: Stop it!
ROSE: You're not like this.. you LOVE each other.  
JACKIE: Oh, Pete. You never used to like them mental. Or I dunno, maybe you did. 
PETE: Jackie, wait, just listen--
JACKIE: If you're not careful, there'll be a wedding and a divorce on the same day. 
PETE: Right, wait here. Give us a couple of minutes with the missus. 
PETE: Tell you what, straighten the car up. Stick her round the corner or something. Don't cause any more trouble...
TINY MICKEY: Jeff...!
JACKIE: I'm not listening. It's just the duffel coats all over again. 
PETE: Jackie, sometimes a duffel coat is just a duffel coat. Things will get better soon, I promise. 
JACKIE: I've had enough of all your daft schemes. I never know where the next meal's coming from. 
PETE: I'll get it right, love. I promise, one day soon I'll get it right. Come on...
TINY MICKEY: Monsters! Coming to eat us!
SUZIE: What sort of monsters, sweetheart? Is it aliens?
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose!
NINTH DOCTOR: Get in the church! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Get in the church! 
SUZIE: Oh, my God. What are they? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Inside! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Stay in there! 
NINTH DOCTOR: In! 
NINTH DOCTOR: They can't get in. Old windows and doors, okay. The older something is, the stronger it is. What else?
NINTH DOCTOR: Go and check the other doors! Move!
JACKIE: What's happening? What are they? What ARE they? 
NINTH DOCTOR: There's been an accident in time, a wound in time. They're like bacteria, taking advantage. 
JACKIE: What do you mean, time? What're you jabbering on about, time? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, I might've known you'd argue. Jackie, I'm sick of you complaining--
JACKIE: How d'you know my name? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I haven't got time for this--
JACKIE: I've never met you in my life!
NINTH DOCTOR: No, and you never will unless I sort this out. Now, if you don't mind - I've waited a long time to say this - Jackie Tyler, do as I say. Go - and - check - the - doors. 
JACKIE: Yes, sir.  
NINTH DOCTOR: I should've done that ages ago. 
STUART: My dad was out there.
NINTH DOCTOR: You can mourn him later, right now we've got to concentrate on keeping ourselves alive. 
STUART: My dad had--
NINTH DOCTOR: There's NOTHING I can do for him. 
STUART: No. But he had this phone thing. I can't get it to work. I keep getting this voice...
VOICE: Watson - come here - we need you. Watson - come here - we need you. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's the very first phone-call, Alexander Graham Bell. I don't think the telephone's gonna be much use. 
STUART: But someone must call the police!
NINTH DOCTOR: Police can't help you now.  No-one can. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nothing in this Universe can harm those things. Time's been damaged and they've come to sterilise the wound. By consuming everything in sight.
ROSE: Is this because...
ROSE: Is this my fault?
PETE: There's smoke coming up from the city but no sirens. I - I don't think it's just us, I think these things are all over the place. Maybe the whole world. 
PETE: Was that a car? 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not important. Don't worry about it. 
PETE: This mate of yours... what do you mean, this is your fault?
ROSE: Dunno… just... everything. 
PETE: I gave you my car keys.
PETE: You don't give your keys to a complete stranger. 
PETE: It's... it's like I trusted you. Moment I met you, I just did. A wound in time...
PETE: You called me Dad. I can see it... my eyes... Jackie's attitude... you sound like her when you shout...
PETE: You are. You are.... you're my Rose. You're my Rose grown up.
ROSE: Dad... my Dad. My Daddy...
STUART: Excuse me! Mr...
NINTH DOCTOR: Doctor.
STUART: You seem to know what's going on.
NINTH DOCTOR: I give that impression, yeah. 
STUART: I just wanted to ask--
SARAH: Can you save us?
NINTH DOCTOR: Who are you two, then? 
STUART: Stuart Hoskins.
SARAH: Sarah Clarke. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And one extra. Boy or girl? 
SARAH: I don't know. I don't want to know, really. 
NINTH DOCTOR: How did all this get started? 
STUART: Outside the Big Box Club. Two in the morning.
SARAH: Street corner. I'd lost my purse. Didn't have money for a taxi. 
STUART: I took her home.
NINTH DOCTOR: Then what? Asked her for a date? 
SARAH: Wrote his number on the back of my hand. 
STUART: Never got rid of her since. My dad said--
SARAH: I don't know what this is all about. And I know WE'RE not important...
NINTH DOCTOR: Who said you're not important? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I've travelled to all sorts of places. Done things you couldn't even imagine,  but... you two... street corner. Two in the morning. Getting a taxi home. I've never had a life like that. Yes. I'll try and save you. 
PETE: I'm a dad. I mean, I'm already a dad, but... Rose grows up, and she's you. That's wonderful. I suppose I thought that you'd be a bit - useless - what, with my useless genes and all, but...
PETE: How did you get here? 
ROSE: Do you really wanna know?
PETE: Yeah! 
ROSE: A time machine. 
PETE: Time machine.
ROSE: Cross my heart. 
PETE: What, do they all have time machines where you come from?
ROSE: Nah, just the Doctor. 
PETE: Did you know these things were coming? 
ROSE: No.
PETE: God, I dunno, my head's spinning. 
PETE: What's the future like? 
ROSE: It's not so different. 
PETE: What am I like? Have I gone grey? 
PETE: Have I gone bald? Don't tell me I've gone bald. 
PETE: So, if this mate of yours isn't your boyfriend - and I have to say, I'm glad because being your dad and all, I think he's a bit old for you...
PETE: Have you got a bloke? 
ROSE: No, I did have--
JACKIE: Mickey! 
PETE: Do you know him?
ROSE: I just didn't recognise him in a suit-- you'll have to let go of me, sweetheart...
ROSE: I'm always saying that...
JACKIE: He just grabs hold of what's passing and holds on for dear life. God help his poor girlfriend if he ever gets one.
PETE: Me and Rose were just talking...
JACKIE: Oh, yeah? Talking? While the world comes to an end, what do you do? Cling to the youngest blonde. 
JACKIE: Come on, Mick. 
ROSE: You can't tell her. 
PETE: Why?
ROSE: I mean... I really don't WANT you to tell her. 
PETE: What do you don't want people to know?
ROSE: Where I come from, Jackie doesn't know how to work the timer on the video recorder. 
PETE: I showed her that last week.
PETE: Point taken. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Now, Rose... you're not gonna bring about the end of the world, are you? Are you? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Jackie gave her to me to look after. How times change.
ROSE: I'd better be careful. I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey like a mother chicken.
NINTH DOCTOR: No. Don't touch the baby. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're both the same person and that's a paradox, and we don't want a paradox happening. Not with these things outside. Anything new - any disturbance in time makes them stronger. The paradox might let them in. 
ROSE: Can't do anything right, can I? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Since you ask, no. So, don't - touch - the - baby.
ROSE: I'm - not - stupid. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You could've fooled me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: All right. I'm sorry. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I wasn't really gonna leave you on your own. 
ROSE: I know. 
NINTH DOCTOR: But between you and me, I haven't got a plan. No idea. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No way out. 
ROSE: You'll think of something. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The entire Earth is being sterilised. This, and other places like it, are all that's left of the human race. We might hold out for a while, but nothing can stop those creatures.
NINTH DOCTOR: They'll get through in the end. The walls aren't that old. And there's nothing I can do to stop them. There used to be laws stopping this kind of thing from happening - my people would have stopped this. But they're all gone. And now I'm going the same way. 
ROSE: If I'd realised...
NINTH DOCTOR: Just... tell me you're sorry. 
ROSE: I am. I'm sorry.
ROSE: Have you got something hot?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's the TARDIS key! It's telling me it's still connected to the TARDIS!
NINTH DOCTOR: The inside of my ship was thrown out of a wound but we can use THIS to bring it back. And once I've got my ship back, then I can mend everything. Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a battery?
STUART: This one big enough?
NINTH DOCTOR: Fantastic.
STUART: Good old dad. There you go.
NINTH DOCTOR: Just need to do a bit of charging up... And then we can bring everyone back.
PETE: You, um... you never said why you came here in the first place. If I had a time machine, I wouldn't have thought 1987 was anything special. Not round here, anyway.
ROSE: We just ended up here.
PETE: Lucky for me, eh? If you hadn't been there to save me...
ROSE: That was just a coincidence. That was just... REALLY good luck. It's amazing...
PETE: So, in the future, are me and her indoors still together?
ROSE: Yeah. 
PETE: Are you still living with us?
ROSE: Yep!
PETE: Am I a good dad?
ROSE: You... you told me a bedtime story every night when I was small. You were always there... you never missed one.
ROSE: And um... you took us for picnics in the country every Saturday. You never let us down. You were there for us all the time.
ROSE: Someone I could really rely on.
PETE: That's not me.
NINTH DOCTOR: Right, no-one touches that key. Have you got that? Don't touch it. Anyone touches that key, it'll be - well - ZAP. Just leave it be and everything will be fine. We'll get out of here. All of us. Stuart - Sarah - you're gonna get married, just like I said.
ROSE: When time gets sorted out...
NINTH DOCTOR: Everybody here forgets what happened. And don't worry - the thing that you changed will stay changed.
PETE: You mean I'll still be alive.
PETE: Though I'm meant to be dead.
PETE: That's why I haven't done anything with my life. Why I didn't MEAN anything.
NINTH DOCTOR: It doesn't work like that.
PETE: Rubbish. I'm so useless I couldn't even die properly. Now it's my fault all of this has happened.
ROSE: This is MY fault.
PETE: No, love. I'm your dad. It's my job for it to be my fault.
JACKIE: Her dad? How are you her dad? How old were you, twelve?
JACKIE: Oh, that's DISGUSTING.
PETE: Jacks - listen. This is Rose.
JACKIE: Rose? How sick is that? You give my daughter a second hand name? How many are there? Do you call them ALL Rose?
PETE: Oh, for God's sake, look! It's the SAME Rose!
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose! No!
NINTH DOCTOR: Everyone! Behind me!
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm the oldest thing in here.
ROSE: Doctor!
ROSE: Cold. He's cold.
ROSE: Oh, my God, he's dead.
ROSE: It's all my fault... all of you... both of you...
ROSE: ... the whole world...
BEV: This is it. There's nothing we can do. It's the end.
PETE: The Doctor really cared about you...
PETE: He didn't want you to go through it again if there was another way. Now there isn't.
ROSE: What're you talking about?
PETE: The car that should've killed me, love. It's here. The Doctor worked it out way back, but he, er - he tried to protect me.
PETE: Still - he's not in charge anymore. I am.
ROSE: But you can't...
PETE: Who am I, love?
ROSE: My Daddy.
PETE: Jackie... look at her. She's ours.
JACKIE: Oh, God...
PETE: I'm meant to be dead, Jackie. You're gonna get rid of me at last.
JACKIE: Don't say that.
PETE: For once in your life, trust me. It's got be done. You've got to survive, because you've got to bring up our daughter.
PETE: I never read you those bedtime stories. I never took you on those picnics. I was never there for you.
ROSE: You would've been.
PETE: But I can do this for you. I can be a proper dad to you now.
ROSE: But it's not fair.
PETE: I've had all these extra hours. No-one else in the world has ever had that. And on top of that... I get to see you. And you're beautiful.
PETE: How lucky am I, eh? So, come on... do as your dad says.
PETE: Are you going to be there for me, love?
PETE: Thanks for saving me.
PETE: Goodbye, love...
NINTH DOCTOR: Go to him. Quick.
JACKIE: The driver was just a kid.
JACKIE: He stopped. He waited for the police. It wasn't his fault. For some reason, Pete just ran out. JACKIE: People say there was this girl... and she sat with Pete while he was dying. And she held his hand. Then she was gone. Never found out who she was.
ROSE: Peter Alan Tyler, my Dad. The most wonderful man in the world. Died the 7th of November, 1987.
