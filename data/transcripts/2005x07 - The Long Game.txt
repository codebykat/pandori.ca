REPORTER: Solar flare activity has increased across space links 556 and all commercial flights are advised to...
NINTH DOCTOR: So, it's 200 000, it's a spaceship... no wait a minute, space station, and uh... go and try that gate over there. Off you go! 
ROSE: 200 000?
NINTH DOCTOR: 200 000. 
ROSE: 'Kay. 
ROSE: Adam? Out you come. 
ADAM: Oh my God. 
ROSE: Don't worry, you'll get used to it. 
ADAM: Where are we? 
ROSE: Good question. Let's see. So, um... judging by the architecture, I'd say we're around the year 200 000.
ROSE: If you listen... engines. 
ROSE: We're on some sort of space station. Yeah. Definitely a space station. It's a bit warm in here, they could turn the heating down... Tell you what - let's try that gate. Come on!
ROSE: Here we go! And this is... 
ROSE: ...I'll let the Doctor describe it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The fourth great and bountiful human empire. And there it is. Planet Earth at its height. Covered with mega-cities, five moons - population 96 billion. The hub of a galactic domain, stretching across a million planets, a million species - with mankind right in the middle.
NINTH DOCTOR: He's your boyfriend.
ROSE: Not anymore.
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on, Adam. Open your mind. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're gonna like this fantastic period of history. The human race at its most intelligent - culture, art, politics. This era has got fine food, good manners--
MAN: Out of the way!
CHEF: One at a time...
CHEF: Oi! You, mate! Stop pushing. Get back. I SAID, back. 
ROSE: Fine cuisine? 
NINTH DOCTOR: My watch must be wrong. No, it's fine... weird. 
ROSE: That's what comes of showing off. Your history's not as good as you thought it was.
NINTH DOCTOR: My history's perfect. 
ROSE: Well, obviously not...
ADAM: They're all human. What about the millions of planets? The millions of species? Where are they?
NINTH DOCTOR: Good question. Actually, that IS a good question. Adam, me' old mate, you must be starving.
ADAM: No, I'm just a bit time sick.
NINTH DOCTOR: Nah, you just need a bit of grub. Oi, mate - how much is a cronk burger? 
CHEF: Two credits twenty, sweetheart. Now, join the queue. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Money. We need money. Have to use a cash point. 
NINTH DOCTOR: There you go - pocket money. Don't spend it all on sweets.
ADAM: How does it work? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Go and find out! Stop nagging me! The thing is, Adam, time travel's like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guide book, you've got to throw yourself in. Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers.
NINTH DOCTOR: ...or is that just me? Stop asking questions, go on, do it!
NINTH DOCTOR: Off you go then! Your first date. 
ROSE: You're going to get a smack, you are. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Erm... this is gonna sound daft, but can you tell me where I am? 
CATHICA: Floor 139... could they write it any bigger?
NINTH DOCTOR: Floor 139 of what? 
CATHICA: Must've been a hell of a party. 
SUKI: Oh, you're on Satellite Five. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What's Satellite Five?
CATHICA: Come on, how could you get on board without knowing where you are?
NINTH DOCTOR: Look at me, I'm stupid. 
SUKI: Hang on, wait a minute - are you a test? Some sort of management test kind of thing?
NINTH DOCTOR: You've got me. Well done. You're too clever for me.
SUKI: We were warned about this in basic training. All workers have to be versed in company promotion.
CATHICA: Right. Fire away, ask your questions. If it gets me to Floor 500 I'll do anything.
NINTH DOCTOR: Why, what happens on Floor 500?
CATHICA: The walls are made of gold. And you should know... Mr. Management. So... this is what we do.
CATHICA: Latest news... sandstorms on the new Venus archipelago. Two hundred dead. Glasgow water riots into their third day... spacelane 37 closed by sunspot activity. And over on the Bad Wolf channel, the Face of Bo has just announced he's pregnant.
NINTH DOCTOR: I get it. You broadcast the news.
CATHICA: We ARE the news.
CATHICA: We're the journalists. We write it, package it and sell it.
CATHICA: 600 channels all coming out of Satellite Five, broadcasting everywhere.
THE EDITOR: Something... is wrong. Something fictional.
THE EDITOR: Those people.
CATHICA: Nothing happens in the whole human empire without it going though us.
THE EDITOR: Security check. Go deep.
LOUDSPEAKER: All staff are reminded that the canteen area now has self cleaning tables. Thank you!
ROSE: Try this. It's called 'zaffic', it's nice. It's like a - um - slush puppy.
ADAM: What flavour?
ROSE: Um... Sort of, beef?
ADAM: Oh, my God...
ADAM: It's like everything's gone. Home - family - everything.
ROSE: This helps... the Doctor gave it a bit of a top-up. Who's back home, your mum and dad?
ADAM: Yeah.
ROSE: Phone 'em up.
ADAM: But that's one hundred and ninety- eight thousand years ago.
ROSE: Honestly, try it. Go on!
ADAM: Is there a code for planet Earth?
ROSE: Just dial!
ANSWERING MACHINE: I'm sorry we're not in.
ADAM: It's on!
ANSWERING MACHINE: Please leave a message. Thanks, bye!
ADAM: Hi. It's... it's me.
ADAM: I've sort of gone... traveling.
ADAM: I met these people... and we've gone traveling together. But, um... I'm fine... and I'll call you later. Love you. Bye.
ADAM: That is just--
NINTH DOCTOR: Oi! Mutt and Jeff! Over here!
COMPUTER: Security check cleared.
THE EDITOR: No, something's WRONG. I can taste it. Tiny little shift in the information. Someone down there shouldn't be here.
THE EDITOR: Double check. Triple check. Follow them. 
CATHICA: Now. Everybody behave. We have a management inspection. How do you want it? By the book?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, right from scratch, thanks. 
CATHICA: Ok, so - ladies, gentlemen, multisex, undecided or robot - my name is Cathica Santini Kadainy. That's Cathica with a 'C', in case you want to write to Floor 500 praising me, and please... do...
CATHICA: Now, please feel free to ask any questions. The process of news gathering must be open, honest, and be non-biased. That's company policy. 
She turns to smile at the Doctor. The Doctor nods.
SUKI: Actually… it's the law. 
CATHICA: Yes, thank you, Suki. Okay, keep it calm... don't show off for the guests... here we go. And... engage safety...
CATHICA: And 3... 2... and spike. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Compressed information, streaming into her. Reports from every city, every country, every planet, and they all get packaged inside her head. She becomes part of the software. Her brain IS the computer. 
ROSE: If it all goes through her, she must be a genius. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nah. She wouldn't remember any. There's too much, her head would blow up. 
He begins to walk around the room, circling the octagonal platform. Rose follows.
NINTH DOCTOR: The brain's the processor. As soon as it closes, she forgets. 
ROSE: So, what about all these people round the edge?
NINTH DOCTOR: They've all got tiny little chips in their head, connecting them to her -and they transmit 600 channels. Every single fact in the empire beams out of this place. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Now, that's what I call power. 
COMPUTER: Analysis confirmed. Security breach.
THE EDITOR: I knew it. Which one? It's someone inside that room, which one? 
COMPUTER: Isolating breach.
THE EDITOR: Come on, show me. Who is it? 
ROSE: You alright? 
ADAM: I can see her brain. 
ROSE: Do you want to get out? 
ADAM: No... no. This is technology, it's... it's amazing. 
NINTH DOCTOR: This technology's wrong. 
ROSE: Trouble?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh yeah. 
THE EDITOR: That's it! Yes! She's the liar. 
THE EDITOR: Intercept and scan. Gotcha. 
CATHICA: Come off it, Suki, I wasn't even halfway, what was that for? 
SUKI: Sorry, must've been a glitch... 
THE EDITOR: Her information's been tampered with. There's a second biography hidden underneath.
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: Yes, sir? 
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: Absolutely, sir. Yeah, well - her data was encrypted so there's no way we could've found her sooner.
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: Yeah. I-- sorry, sir. Absolutely. Get her up here. Now.
LOUDSPEAKER: Promotion. 
CATHICA: This is it. Come on. God, make it me. Come on, say my name. 
CATHICA: Say my name, say my name...
LOUDSPEAKER: Promotion for... Suki Macrae Cantrell. 
LOUDSPEAKER: Please proceed to Floor 500. 
SUKI: I don't believe it... Floor 500...
CATHICA: How the hell did you manage that? I'm above you! 
SUKI: I don't know, I just applied on the off-chance... and they've said yes! 
CATHICA: That's so not fair, I've been applying to Floor 500 for three years! 
ROSE: What's Floor 500?
NINTH DOCTOR: The walls are made of gold.
SUKI: Cathica, I'm gonna miss you! Floor 500... Thank you!
NINTH DOCTOR: I didn't do anything! 
SUKI: Well, you're my lucky charm!
NINTH DOCTOR: All right! I'll hug anyone!
ROSE: Come on, it's not that bad...
ADAM: What, with the... the head thing? 
ROSE: Yeah, well she's closed it now!
ADAM: Yeah but... it's everything. It freaks me out. And I just need to... if I could just... ...cool down. Sort of, acclimatize.
ROSE: How d'you mean? 
ADAM: Maybe... I could just go and sit on the observation deck? Would that be all right? 
ADAM: Soak it in, you know, pretend I'm a citizen of the year 200 000. 
ROSE: Do you want me to come with you?
ADAM: No, no, you stick with the Doctor. 
ADAM: You'd rather be with him. 
ADAM: It's gonna take a better man than me to get between you two. Anyway - I'll be on the deck.
ROSE: Here you go... take the TARDIS key. You know, just in case it gets a bit too much.
ADAM: Yeah, like it's not weird in there. 
SUKI: Oh, my God, I've got to go, I can't keep them waiting-- I'm sorry! Say goodbye to Steve for me. 
SUKI: Bye!
CATHICA: Good riddance. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're talking like you'll never see her again. She's only going upstairs. 
CATHICA: We won't. Once you go to Floor 500 you never come back. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Have you ever been up there?
CATHICA: No. You need a key for the lift, and you only get a key with promotion. No one gets to 500 except for the chosen few.
SUKI: Who're you?
THE EDITOR: I'm the Editor. 
SUKI: What's happening? There're... bodies out there, what's going on?
THE EDITOR: Well, while we're asking questions, would you please confirm your name. 
PROJECTION OF SUKI: My name is Suki Macrae Cantrell. I was born 1-9-9 apostrophe 8-9 in the Independent Republic of Morocco. 
THE EDITOR: Liar. 
PROJECTION OF SUKI: Hobbies include reading and archaeology. I'm not an expert or anything, I just like digging. 
THE EDITOR: Liar!
PROJECTION OF SUKI: I want to work for Satellite Five because my sister can't afford university.
PROJECTION OF SUKI: And the pay scheme is really good--
THE EDITOR: Liar! 
THE EDITOR: Let's look at the facts, shall we? 
THE EDITOR: Ah, hidden behind a genetic graft, but that's still you. Eva San Julienne. Last surviving member of the Freedom Fifteen! Hmm, self declared anarchist, is that right?
SUKI: Who controls Satellite Five? 
THE EDITOR: There's the truth! 
SUKI: The Freedom Foundation has been monitoring Satellite Five's transmissions. We have absolute proof that the facts are being manipulated. YOU are lying to the people. 
THE EDITOR: Ohh, I love it. Say it again. 
SUKI: This whole system is corrupt. Who do you represent? 
THE EDITOR: I'm merely a humble slave. I answer to the Editor in Chief.
SUKI: Well, who is he? Where is he? 
THE EDITOR: He's overseeing everything. Literally everything. 
THE EDITOR: If you don't mind, I'm going to have to refer this upwards. 
SUKI: What is that? 
THE EDITOR: Your boss. This has always been your boss. Since the day you were born. 
ADAM: Give me access...
ADAM: I can learn anything. 
ADAM: Let's try... uh, computers. From the 21st Century to the present date, give me the history of the Microprocessor. 
ADAM: Oh my God. 
CATHICA: Look, they only give us twenty minutes maintenance, can't you give it a rest? 
NINTH DOCTOR: But you've never been to another floor? Not even one floor down? 
CATHICA: I went to floor 16 when I first arrived, that's medical, that's when I got my head done, and then I - I came straight here. Satellite Five - you work, eat and sleep on the same floor. That's it, that's all. You're not management, are you. 
NINTH DOCTOR: At last! She's clever!
CATHICA: Yeah, well, whatever it is, don't involve me. I don't know anything. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't you even ask?
CATHICA: Well, why WOULD I? 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're a journalist! Why's all the crew human?
CATHICA: What's that got to do with anything? 
NINTH DOCTOR: There's no aliens on board. Why? 
CATHICA: I don't know - no real reason, they're not banned or anything. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Then where are they? 
CATHICA: I suppose immigration's tightened up. It's had to, what, with all the threats. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What threats?
CATHICA: I don't know... all of them. Usual stuff. And the price of space warp doubled so that kept the visitors away... 
CATHICA: Oh, and the government on Traffic Five's collapsed, so that lot stopped coming, you see... just... lots of little reasons, that's all. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Adding up to one great big fact, and you didn't even notice. 
CATHICA: Doctor, I think if there was any kind of conspiracy, Satellite Five would have seen it. We see everything. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I can see better. This society's the wrong shape. Even the technology. 
CATHICA: It's cutting edge!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's backward! There's a great big door in your head! You should've chucked this out years ago.
ROSE: So, what do you think is going on? 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not just this space station, it's the whole attitude. It's the way people think. The great and bountiful human empire's stunted. Something's holding it back.
CATHICA: And how would you know?
NINTH DOCTOR: Trust me. Humanity's been set back about 90 years - when did Satellite Five start broadcasting? 
CATHICA: 91 years ago... 
ADAM: Mum - Dad - KEEP this message, okay? Whatever you do, DON'T erase it. 
ADAM: Save it. You got that? 
ADAM: The microprocessor became redundant in the year 2019, when it was replaced by a system called SMT - that's Single Molecule Transcription--
ADAM: No, no, no, no, no, no! What're you doing! Come back! Come--
ADAM: Why are you doing that? 
ADAM: What's Floor 16? What's down there? 
ADAM: Sorry, um - Floor 16 - that's, um... what do you cover? 
NURSE: Medical non-emergency. 
ADAM: Right - wrong floor - I'm having technical difficulties, my screen keeps freezing - blocking me out. 
NURSE: No, that's medical... there must be something wrong with your chip.
ADAM: Yes. Yeah, of course, yeah. I haven't got one. 
NURSE: No wonder you can't get a screen to work. 
NURSE: What are you, a... student? 
ADAM: Yes, yeah, I'm um... I'm on a research project from... the University of Mars. 
NURSE: The Martian Boondocks. Typical.  
ADAM: Yep. 
NURSE: Well, you still need chipping. 
ADAM: So... does that mean like... brain surgery? 
NURSE: That's an old fashioned phrase... but it's the same thing, yes. 
ADAM: Oh... okay... never mind. But if I get a chip... that means I could use ANY computer. 
NURSE: Absolutely. You'll... have to pay for it. They've stopped subsidizing. 
ADAM: Oh! Right. Sorry. Wasting your time. Thanks. 
ADAM: Hold on... can I use this?
NURSE: That'll do nicely. 
NURSE: It all comes down to two basic types. Type one - the head chip. Inserted into the back of the skull - one hundred credits. There's the chip... Tiny. Invisible. Type two is the full info-spike. 
ADAM: Oh, um... that's the... ...thing.
NURSE: That's the one. It does cost ten thousand. 
ADAM: Oh, well I um... I couldn't afford it, then. 
NURSE: Not at all! Turns out - you've got unlimited credit. 
ADAM: No, but... I couldn't have it done, I mean... that's gotta hurt, hasn't it? 
NURSE: Painless. Contractual guarantee. 
ADAM: No, my mate's waiting upstairs, I can't have major surgery. 
NURSE: It takes ten minutes. That sort of money buys a very fast picosurgeon. 
ADAM: No, but I... I couldn't, no, no. It's... 
NURSE: Type one - you can interface with a simple computer. Type two - you are the computer. You can transmit any piece of information from the archive of Satellite Five, which is just about the entire history of the human race. Now... Which one's it going to be?
CATHICA: We're SO gonna get in trouble. 
CATHICA: You're not allowed to touch the mainframe, you're gonna get told off. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, tell her to button it. 
CATHICA: You can't just vandalise the place, someone's gonna notice! 
THE EDITOR: I don't understand! We did a full security scan. That man was there when we found Suki Macrae Cantrell. There were no indications about him. And yet here he is... Clearly acting outside the parameters. Fascinating.
THE EDITOR: Yes, sir. Absolutely. At once. Check him. Double check him. Triple check him. Quadruple. 
JAGRAFESS: *rumble*
CATHICA: This is nothing to do with me, I'm going back to work. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Go on then! See ya!
CATHICA: I can't just leave you, can I!
ROSE: If you wanna be useful, get 'em to turn the heating down. It's boiling. What's wrong with this place, can't they do something about it? 
CATHICA: I don't know, we keep asking - something to do with the turbine. 
NINTH DOCTOR: "Something to do with the turbine". 
CATHICA: Well, I don't know!
NINTH DOCTOR: Exactly! I give up on you, Cathica. Now, Rose - look at Rose. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose is asking the right kind of questions. 
ROSE: Oh, thank you. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Why is it so hot?
CATHICA: One minute you're worried about the Empire and the next it's the central heating! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, never underestimate plumbing. Plumbing's very important. 
COMPUTER: Security scan complete. 
THE EDITOR: Well, who is he?
COMPUTER: He is no-one. 
THE EDITOR: What does that mean? 
COMPUTER: He is no- one. 
THE EDITOR: What, you mean he has a fake ID? 
COMPUTER: He has no identification. 
THE EDITOR: But everyone's registered. We have a census for the entire Empire. 
COMPUTER: He is no-one.
THE EDITOR: What, he doesn't exist? Not anywhere?
COMPUTER: He is no-one. 
THE EDITOR: What about the blonde?
COMPUTER: She is no-one. 
THE EDITOR: Both of them?! Well! We all know what happens to non-entities. They get promoted. Bring them up. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Here we go - Satellite Five. Pipes and plumbing. Look at the layout. 
CATHICA: This is ridiculous. You've got access to the computer's core. You can look at the archive, the news, the stock exchange... and you're looking at pipes? 
NINTH DOCTOR: But there's something wrong. 
CATHICA: I suppose...
ROSE: Why, what is it?
CATHICA: The ventilation system. Cooling ducts, ice filters, all working flat out... channelling massive amounts of heat DOWN.
NINTH DOCTOR: All the way from the top.
ROSE: Floor 500. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Something up there is generating tonnes and tonnes of heat. 
ROSE: Well, I don't know about you, but I feel like I'm missing out on a party. It's all going on upstairs. Fancy a trip?
CATHICA: You can't, you need a key. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Keys are just codes, and I've got the codes right here. Here we go - override 215.9.
CATHICA: How come it's giving you the code?
NINTH DOCTOR: Someone up there likes me. 
NURSE: I told you it was painless. No scarring, you see? Perfect success. 
ADAM: How do I activate it? 
NURSE: It's a personal choice. Some people whistle... I know one man who triggers it with 'Oh, Danny Boy'. 
NURSE: But you're set on default for now. That's a click of the fingers. 
ADAM: So you mean, I just... 
NURSE: Click. 
ROSE: Come on, come with us!
CATHICA: No way!
NINTH DOCTOR: Bye!
CATHICA: Well, don't mention my name. When you get in trouble, just don't involve me!
NINTH DOCTOR: That's her gone. Adam's given up. Looks like it's just you and me. 
ROSE: Yeah. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Good. 
ROSE: Yep. 
ADAM: Oh, my God. I'm gonna be sick. 
NURSE: Special offer. We installed the vomit-o-matic at the same time. Nano-termites have been placed in the lining of your throat. In the event of sickness... They freeze the waste. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The walls are not made of gold. You should go back downstairs. 
ROSE: Tough. 
THE EDITOR: I started without you. This is fascinating. Satellite Five contains every piece of information within the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. Birth certificates, shopping habits, bank statements, but YOU two... you don't exist! 
THE EDITOR: Not a trace! No birth - no job - not the slightest kiss. How can you walk through the world and not leave a single footprint? 
ROSE: Suki! Suki! 
ROSE: Hello? Can you hear me? Suki? What've you done to her?
NINTH DOCTOR: I think she's dead. 
ROSE: She's working...
NINTH DOCTOR: They've all got chips in their head, and the chips keep going. Like puppets. 
THE EDITOR: Ohhhh! You're full of information! But it's only fair we get information back, because apparently, you're no-one. 
THE EDITOR: It's so rare not to know something. Who are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: It doesn't matter, 'cause we're off. Nice to meet you. Come on. 
THE EDITOR: Tell me who you are! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Since that information's keeping us alive, I'm hardly gonna say, am I? 
THE EDITOR: Well, perhaps my Editor in Chief can convince you otherwise. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And who's that?
THE EDITOR: It may interest you to know that this is NOT the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. In fact, it's not actually human at all. It's merely a place where humans happen to live.
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: Yeah-- sorry. It's a place where humans are allowed to live by kind permission of my client.
ROSE: What is that? 
NINTH DOCTOR: You mean, that thing's in charge of Satellite Five? 
THE EDITOR: That 'thing' - as you put it - is in charge of the human race. 
THE EDITOR: For almost a hundred years, mankind has been shaped and guided, his knowledge and ambition strictly controlled by its broadcast news. Edited by my superior - your master - and humanities guiding light - the mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: I call him Max. 
THE EDITOR: If we create a climate of fear... then it's easy to keep the borders closed. It's just a matter of emphasis. The right word in the right broadcast repeated often enough can destabilize an economy... invent an enemy... change a vote...
ROSE: So, all the people on Earth are like, slaves. 
THE EDITOR: Well, now. There's an interesting point. Is a slave a slave if he doesn't know he's enslaved? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes. 
THE EDITOR: Oh. I was hoping for a philosophical debate. Is that all I'm going to get? 'Yes'?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes. 
THE EDITOR: You're no fun. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Let me out of these manacles - you'll find out how much fun I am. 
THE EDITOR: Oh, he's tough, isn't he. But, come on. Isn't it a great system? You've got to admire it, just a little bit. 
ROSE: You can't hide something on this scale. Somebody must've noticed. 
THE EDITOR: From time to time, someone, yes. But the computer system allows me to see inside their brain... I can see the smallest doubt - and crush it. 
THE EDITOR: And then they just carry on, living their life. Strutting about downstairs and all over the surface of the Earth like they're SO individual. 
THE EDITOR: When of course, they're not. They're just cattle. In that respect, the Jagrafess hasn't changed a thing. 
ROSE: What about you? You're not a Jagra... uh... a...
NINTH DOCTOR: Jagrafess.
ROSE: Jagrafess. You're not a Jagrafess. You're human. 
THE EDITOR: Yeah, well simply being human doesn't pay very well. 
ROSE: But you couldn't have done this all on your own. 
THE EDITOR: No! I represent a consortium of banks. Money prefers a long-term investment. Also, the Jagrafess needed a little hand to um... install himself. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No wonder, a creature that size. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What's his life span?
THE EDITOR: Three thousand years.
NINTH DOCTOR: That's one hell of a metabolism generating all that heat. That's why Satellite Five's so hot. You pump it out of the creature, channel it downstairs - Jagrafess stays cool - stays alive. Satellite Five's one great big life support system. 
ADAM: Me again. Don't wipe this message. It's just gonna sound like white noise, but save it because I can translate it. Okay? Three, two, one... and spike. 
THE EDITOR: But THAT'S why you're so dangerous. Knowledge is power, but you remain unknown.
THE EDITOR: Who are you? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Leave her alone. I'm the Doctor, she's Rose Tyler, we're nothing, we're just wandering. 
THE EDITOR: Tell me who you are!
NINTH DOCTOR: I just said! 
THE EDITOR: Yeah, but who do you work for? Who sent you? Who knows about us? Who exactly--
THE EDITOR: Time Lord. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What?
THE EDITOR: Oh, yes! The last of the Time Lords in his traveling machine. Oh, with his little human girl from long ago...
NINTH DOCTOR: You don't know what you're talking about. 
THE EDITOR: Time travel. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Someone's been telling you lies. 
THE EDITOR: Young master Adam Mitchell?
ROSE: Oh, my God - his head! 
NINTH DOCTOR: What the hell's he done? What the hell's he gone and done? 
NINTH DOCTOR: They're reading his mind. He's telling them everything!
THE EDITOR: And through him, I know everything about you. Every piece of information in his head is now mine. And you have infinite knowledge, Doctor. The Human Empire is tiny compared to what you've seen in your T-A-R-D-I-S - TARDIS. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You'll never get your hands on it. I'll die first. 
THE EDITOR: Die all you like. I don't need you. I've got the key. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You and your boyfriends! 
THE EDITOR: Today, WE are the headlines. We can rewrite history. We could prevent mankind from ever developing. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And no-one's gonna stop you. Because you've bred a human race that doesn't bother to ask questions. Stupid little slaves, believing every lie. They'll just trot right into the slaughterhouse if they're told it's made of gold. 
CATHICA: Disengage safety. 
THE EDITOR: What's happening? 
CATHICA: Maximum access. Override Floor 139. 
CATHICA: And... spike!
THE EDITOR: Someone's disengaged the safety. 
THE EDITOR: Who's that?! 
ROSE: It's Cathica!
NINTH DOCTOR: And she's thinking. She's using what she knows! 
THE EDITOR: Terminate her access. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Everything I told her about Satellite Five - the pipes - the filters - she's reversing it! Look at that...
NINTH DOCTOR: It's getting hot. 
THE EDITOR: I said, terminate!
THE EDITOR: Burn her mind. 
CATHICA: Oh no you don't. You should've promoted me YEARS back. 
NINTH DOCTOR: She's venting the heat up here. The Jagrafess needs to stay cool and now it's sitting on top of a volcano. 
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: Yes! Uh... I'm trying, sir but - I don't know how she did it, it's impossible. A member of staff with an idea--
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
ROSE: What do I do?
NINTH DOCTOR: Flick the switch! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oi, mate - wanna bank on a certainty? Massive heat in a massive body. Massive bang!
NINTH DOCTOR: See you in the headlines!
THE EDITOR: Um - actually, sir - if it's all the same to you, I think I'll resign. Bye, then!
THE EDITOR: Let go of me!
JAGRAFESS: *roar*
THE EDITOR: Let go of me! Let go of me! 
NINTH DOCTOR: We're just gonna go. I hate tidying up. Too many questions. You'll manage. 
CATHICA: You'll have to stay and explain it - no-one's gonna believe me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, they might start believing a lot of things now. The Human Race should accelerate. All back to normal.
CATHICA: What about your friend?
NINTH DOCTOR: He's not my friend. 
ROSE: Now, don't--
ADAM: I'm all right now. Much better. I've got the key. Well, it's... I know... It all worked out for the best, didn't it?
ADAM: You know, it's not actually my fault, because YOU were in charge--
ADAM: It's my house! I'm home! Oh, my God, I'm home! 
ADAM: Blimey. I thought you were going to chuck me out of an airlock. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Is there something else you want to tell me?
ADAM: No. Um... what do you mean?
NINTH DOCTOR: The archive of Satellite Five. One second of that message could've changed the world. 
NINTH DOCTOR: That's it, then. See ya. 
ADAM: How do you mean, 'see ya'?
NINTH DOCTOR: As in 'goodbye'. 
ADAM: But... what about me? You can't just go, I've got my head - I've got a chip type two, my head opens. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What, like this?
ADAM: Don't. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't do what?
ADAM: Stop it!
ROSE: All right now, Doctor, that's enough. Stop it.
ADAM: Thank you. 
ADAM: Oi! 
ROSE: Sorry, I couldn't resist. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The whole of history could've changed because of you. 
ADAM: I just wanted to help. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You were helping yourself. 
ADAM: And - I'm sorry. I've said I'm sorry, and I am, I really am - but you can't just leave me like this.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes I can. 'Cos if you show your head to anyone, they'll dissect you in seconds. You'll have to live a very quiet life. Keep out of trouble. Be average. Unseen. Good luck. 
ADAM: But I wanna come with you! 
NINTH DOCTOR: I only take the best. I've got Rose.
ADAM: Oh my God. 
ADAM'S MUM: Who's that? Jeff? Is that you?
ADAM: It's me - mum - don't come in, wait there a minute. 
ADAM'S MUM: Oh, my Lord! You never told me you were coming home!
ADAM'S MUM: Hold on, I'll just take my coat off. You should've told me you were coming home. I would've got your favourite tea in.
ADAM: Rose… take me with you. 
ADAM'S MUM: Hey, I'll tell-- what's that noise? Have you left the back door open? BLIMEY, there's a draft. 
ADAM'S MUM: What a surprise. Ah, let me look at you. Ah, six months.
ADAM'S MUM: It's like I saw you yesterday. Isn't it funny? The time goes by like 'that'.
