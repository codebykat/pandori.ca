ROSE: What's the emergency?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's mauve.
ROSE: Mauve?
NINTH DOCTOR: The universally recognized colour for danger.
ROSE: What happened to red?
NINTH DOCTOR: That's just humans. By everyone else's standards, red's camp. Oh, the misunderstandings. All those red alerts, all that dancing.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's got a very basic flight computer - I've hacked in, slaved the TARDIS. Where it goes, we go.
ROSE: And how safe is it?
NINTH DOCTOR: Totally.
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay, reasonably. Should have said reasonably there.
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! It's jumping time tracks - getting away from us.
ROSE: What exactly is this thing?
NINTH DOCTOR: No idea.
ROSE: And why are we chasing it?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's mauve and dangerous. And about 30 seconds from the centre of London.
NINTH DOCTOR: Do you know how long we can knock around space without having to bump into Earth?
ROSE: Five days? Or is that just when we're out of milk?
NINTH DOCTOR: Of all the species in all the universe and it has to come out of a cow.
NINTH DOCTOR: Must have come down somewhere quite close. Within a mile, anyway. And it can't have been more than a few weeks ago. Maybe a month.
ROSE: A month?! We were right behind it!
NINTH DOCTOR: It was jumping time tracks all over the place, we're bound to be a little bit out. Do YOU wanna drive?
ROSE: Yeah... how much is 'a little'?
NINTH DOCTOR: A bit.
ROSE: Is that EXACTLY a bit?
NINTH DOCTOR: Ish.
ROSE: What's the plan, then? Are you gonna do a scan for alien tech or something?
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, it hit the middle of London with a very loud bang. I'm gonna ask.
ROSE: Doctor John Smith, Ministry of Asteroids.
NINTH DOCTOR: Psychic Paper, tells you--
ROSE: Whatever you want it to tell me, I remember.
NINTH DOCTOR: Sorry.
ROSE: Not very Spock, is it? Just asking?
NINTH DOCTOR: Door - music - people. What d'you think?
ROSE: I think you should do a scan for alien tech.
ROSE: Gimme some Spock! For once, would it kill ya?
NINTH DOCTOR: Are you sure about that t-shirt?
ROSE: Too early to say. I'm taking it out for a spin.
THE CHILD: Muuuu-mmy?
THE CHILD: Muuuu-mmy?
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on if you're coming. Won't take a minute.
THE CHILD: Muuuuumy?
ROSE: Doctor? Doctor? There's a kid up there!
NIGHTCLUB SINGER: For nobody else gave me the thrill, when I have found I love you still, it had to be you, wonderful you...
ROSE: Are you all right up there?
THE CHILD: Muuuuum-my?
NIGHTCLUB SINGER: It had to be you.
NINTH DOCTOR: Excuse me! Excuse me! Could I have everybody's attention just for a mo? Be very quick, eh... hello! Eh... might seem like a stupid question, but has anything fallen from the sky recently?
THE CHILD: Mummy?
ROSE: Okay - hold on! Don't move!
NINTH DOCTOR: Sorry, have I said something funny?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's just, there's this thing I need to find, would've fallen from the sky a couple of days ago.
NINTH DOCTOR: Would've landed quite near here...
NINTH DOCTOR: With a very loud...
NINTH DOCTOR: Bang...
THE CHILD: Mummy...
THE CHILD: Balloon!
ROSE: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
ROSE: Okay... maybe NOT this t-shirt.
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose!
NINTH DOCTOR: You know... one day. Just one day, maybe... I'm gonna meet someone who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing.
NINTH DOCTOR: How can you be ringing? What's that about? Ringing? What am I supposed to do with a ringing phone?
NANCY: Don't answer it. It's not for you.
NINTH DOCTOR: And how do you know that?
NANCY: 'Cos I do. And I'm tellin' ya - don't answer it.
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, if you know so much, tell me this - how can it be ringing? It's not even a real phone. It's not CONNECTED, it's not--
NINTH DOCTOR: Hello? This is the Doctor speaking. How may I help you?
THE CHILD: Mummy?
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: Who is this? Who's speaking?
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: Who is this?
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: How did you RING here? This isn't a real phone, it's not wired up to anything, it's--
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose? Rose, are you in there?
MRS LLOYD: The planes are coming. Can't you hear them? Into the shelter. None of your nonsense, now MOVE it!
MRS LLOYD: Come on, come on, get in there. Arthur! Arthur! Will you hurry up? Didn't you hear the sirens?
MR LLOYD: Middle of dinner, every night. Bloomin' Germans. Don't you eat?
MRS LLOYD: I can hear the planes!
MR LLOYD: Don't you eat?!
MRS LLOYD: Oh, keep your voice down, will ya? There's an air raid!
MRS LLOYD: Get in... there's a war on.
MR LLOYD: I know there is--
OFFICER: Get those lights out please!
OFFICER: Come on, down to the shelter.
ALGY: Jack? Are you going down to the shelter? Only, I've got to go off on some silly guard duty. Ah! Barrage Balloon, eh? Must've come loose. Happens now and then. Don't you RAF boys use them for target practice?
JACK: Excellent bottom.
ALGY: I say, old man. There's a time and a place. Look - you should really be off.
JACK: Sorry, old man. I've gotta go and meet a girl. But you've got an excellent bottom too.
NANCY: Many kids out there?
JIM: Eh... yes, miss.
NANCY: Ah - still carving. Sit and wait.
NANCY: We've got the whole air raid.
JIM: Look at that. Bet it's off the black market.
NANCY: That's enough.
JACK: Okay, okay, I've got you.
ROSE: Who's got me? Who's got me, and you know... how?
JACK: I'm just programming your descent pattern. Keep as still as you can and keep your hands and feet inside the light field.
ROSE: Descent pattern?
JACK: Oh, and could you switch off your cellphone?
JACK: No, seriously - it interferes with my instruments.
ROSE: You know, no-one ever believes that.
JACK: Thank you. That's much better.
ROSE: Oh, yeah, that's a real load off, that is. I'm hanging in the sky in the middle of a German air raid with the Union Jack across my chest, but hey! My mobile phone's off!
JACK: Be with you in a moment.
COMPUTER: The mobile communication device indicates non-contemporaneous life form.
JACK: She's not from around here, no.
JACK: Ready for you. Hold tight!
ROSE: To what?!
JACK: Fair point.
JACK: I've got you!
JACK: You're fine, you're just fine. The tractor beam, it can scramble your head just a little.
ROSE: Hello.
JACK: Hello.
ROSE: Hello.
ROSE: Sorry, that was hello twice there. Dull, but you know, thorough.
JACK: Are you all right?
ROSE: Fine!
ROSE: Why, are you expecting me to faint or something?
JACK: Well, you do look a little dizzy...
ROSE: What about you? You're not even focused... oh boll--
ERNIE: It's GOT to be black market. He couldn't get all this on coupons.
NANCY: Ernie - how many times? We are guests in this house. We will not make comments of that kind. Washing up.
ERNIE: Oh, Nancy!
NANCY: Haven't seen you at one of these before.
ALF: He told me about it.
NANCY: Sleeping rough?
ALF: Yes, miss.
NANCY: All right then. One slice each, and I want to see everyone chewing properly.
JIM: Thank ya, miss!
ERNIE: Thanks, miss!
ALF: Thank you miss.
NINTH DOCTOR: Thanks, miss!
NANCY: It's all right! Everybody stay where you are!
NINTH DOCTOR: Good here, innit? Who's got the salt?
NANCY: Back in your seats! He shouldn't be here either.
NINTH DOCTOR: So, you lot... what's the story?
ERNIE: What d'you mean?
NINTH DOCTOR: You're homeless, right? Living rough?
JIM: Why d'you wanna know that? Are you a copper?
NINTH DOCTOR: Of course I'm not a copper. What's a copper gonna do with you lot anyway? Arrest you for starving?
NINTH DOCTOR: I make it 1941, you lot shouldn't be in London. You should've been evacuated to the country by now.
ALF: I was evacuated. They sent me to a farm.
NINTH DOCTOR: So why'd you come back?
ALF: There was a man there...
JIM: Yeah, same with Ernie. Two homes ago.
ERNIE: Shut up. It's better on the streets anyway. Better food.
JIM: Yeah. Nancy always gets the best food for us.
NINTH DOCTOR: So, that's what you do is it, Nancy?
NANCY: What is?
NINTH DOCTOR: As soon as the sirens go, you find a big fat family meal, still warm on the table with everyone down in the air raid shelter and - bingo! Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids of London Town. Puddings for all! As long as the bombs don't get you.
NANCY: Something wrong with that?
NINTH DOCTOR: Wrong with it? It's BRILLIANT. I'm not sure if it's Marxism in action or a West End musical.
NANCY: Why'd you follow me? What d'you want?
NINTH DOCTOR: I want to know how a phone that isn't a phone gets a phone call. You seem to be the one to ask.
NANCY: I did you a favour. I told you not to answer it, that's all I'm telling ya.
NINTH DOCTOR: Great, thanks. And I wanna find a blonde in a Union Jack. I mean a specific one, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving.
NINTH DOCTOR: Anybody seen a girl like that?
NINTH DOCTOR: What've I done wrong?
NANCY: You took two slices.
NANCY: No blondes - no flags. Anything else before you leave?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah, there is actually. Thanks for asking. Something I've been looking for, would've fallen from the sky about a month ago, but not a bomb.
NINTH DOCTOR: Not the usual kind anyway. Wouldn't have exploded. Would've just buried itself in the ground somewhere, and it would've looked something like...
NINTH DOCTOR: This.
THE CHILD: Mummy? Are you in there, mummy?
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NANCY: Who was the last one in?
ERNIE: Him.
NANCY: Nah, he came round the back. Who came in the front?
ALF: Me.
NANCY: Did you close the door?
ALF: I...
NANCY: Did you close the door?
THE CHILD: Mummy? Mummy?
THE CHILD: Muuuuum-my?
NINTH DOCTOR: What's this, then? It's never easy being the only child left out in the cold, you know.
NANCY: I suppose you'd know.
NINTH DOCTOR: I do actually, yes.
NANCY: It's not exactly a child.
THE CHILD: Muuum-my?
NANCY: Right, everybody out, across the back garden and under the fence.
NANCY: Now! Go! Move!
NANCY: Come on, baby. You've got to go. Okay? It's just like a game. Just like chasing.
NANCY: Take your coat, go on.
NANCY: Go!
THE CHILD: Mummy?
THE CHILD: Please let me in, mummy.
THE CHILD: Please let me in, mummy.
NINTH DOCTOR: Are you all right?
THE CHILD: Please let me in.
NANCY: You mustn't let him touch ya!
NINTH DOCTOR: What happens if he touches me?
NANCY: He'll make you like him.
NINTH DOCTOR: And what's he like?
NANCY: I've gotta go.
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy, what's he like?
NANCY: He's empty.
NANCY: It's him. He can make phones ring, he can. Just like with that police box you saw.
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
THE CHILD: Mummy? Please let me in, mummy.
THE CHILD: Mummy? Muuum-my, muum-my...
NANCY: Stay if you want to.
THE CHILD: Mummy, mummy, mummy...
THE CHILD: Mummy? Let me in please, mummy...
THE CHILD: PLEASE let me in.
NINTH DOCTOR: Your mummy isn't here.
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: No mummies here. Nobody here but us chickens.
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, THIS chicken.
THE CHILD: I'm scared.
NINTH DOCTOR: Why are those other children frightened of you?
THE CHILD: Please let me in, mummy. I'm scared of the bombs.
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay. I'm opening the door now.
JACK: Better now?
ROSE: You got lights in here?
JACK: Hello.
ROSE: Hello.
JACK: Hello.
ROSE: Let's not start that again.
JACK: Okay.
ROSE: So, um... who're you supposed to be, then?
JACK: Captain Jack Harkness. 133 Squadron Royal Airforce - American Volunteer.
He hands her what would appear to be an ID card. Rose looks at it.
ROSE: Liar.
ROSE: This is psychic paper. It tells me whatever you want it to tell me.
JACK: How do you know?
ROSE: Two things. One - I have a friend who uses this all the time.
JACK: Ah.
ROSE: And two - you just handed me a piece of paper telling me you're single and you work out.
JACK: Tricky things, psychic paper.
ROSE: Yeah - can't let your mind wander when you're handing it over.
JACK: Oh, you 'sort of' have a boyfriend called Mickey Smith but you consider yourself to be footloose and fancy free.
ROSE: Wha--
JACK: Actually, the word you use is 'available'.
ROSE: No way...
JACK: And another one - 'very'.
ROSE: Shall we uh... try and get along WITHOUT the psychic paper?
JACK: That would be better, wouldn't it?
ROSE: Nice spaceship.
JACK: Gets me around.
ROSE: Very... Spock.
JACK: Who?
ROSE: Guessing you're not a local boy, then.
JACK: A cell phone, a liquid crystal watch, and fabrics that won't be around for at least another two decades... guessing you're not a local girl.
ROSE: Guessing right.
JACK: Burn your hands on the rope?
ROSE: Yeah. We're parked in midair! Can't anyone down there see us?
JACK: No. Can I have a look at your hands for a moment?
ROSE: Why?
JACK: Please?
JACK: You can stop acting now. I know exactly who you are. I can spot a Time Agent a mile away.
ROSE: Time Agent?
JACK: I've been expecting one of you guys to show up. Though, not, I must say, by barrage balloon. Do you often travel that way?
ROSE: Sometimes I get swept off my feet. By balloons.
ROSE: What're you doing?
JACK: Try to keep still.
JACK: Nanogenes. Sub-atomic robots. The air in here's full of them.
JACK: They just repaired three layers of your skin.
ROSE: Well, tell them thanks!
JACK: We'll get down to business.
ROSE: Business?
JACK: Shall we have a drink on the balcony?
JACK: Bring up the glasses.
ROSE: I'm standing on something...
ROSE: Okay... you have an invisible spaceship...
JACK: Yeah…
ROSE: Tethered up to Big Ben for some reason...
JACK: First rule of active camouflage. Park somewhere you'll remember.
NANCY: How'd you follow me here?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm good at following, me. Got the nose for it.
NANCY: People can't usually follow me if I don't want them to.
NINTH DOCTOR: My nose has special powers.
NANCY: Yeah? That's why it's uh...
NINTH DOCTOR: What?
NANCY: Nothing.
NINTH DOCTOR: What?
NANCY: Nothing! Do your ears have special powers too?
NINTH DOCTOR: What're you trying to say?
NANCY: Goodnight, Mister.
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy. There's something chasing you and the other kids. Looks like a boy and it isn't a boy, and it started about a month ago, right?
NINTH DOCTOR: The thing I'm looking for. The thing that fell from the sky, that's when it landed. And you know what I'm talking about, don't you?
NANCY: There was a bomb. A bomb that wasn't a bomb. Fell the other end of Limehouse Green Station.
NINTH DOCTOR: Take me there.
NANCY: There's soldiers guarding it, barbed wire... you'll never get through.
NINTH DOCTOR: Try me!
NANCY: You sure you wanna know what's going on in there?
NINTH DOCTOR: I really wanna know.
NANCY: Then there's someone you need to talk to first.
NINTH DOCTOR: And who might that be?
NANCY: The Doctor.
ROSE: You know, it's getting a bit late. I should really be getting back.
JACK: We're discussing business.
ROSE: This isn't business. This is champagne.
JACK: I try never to discuss business with a clear head. JACK: Are you travelling alone? Are you authorised to negotiate with me?
ROSE: What would we be negotiating?
JACK: I have something for the Time Agency. Something they'd like to buy. Are you in power to make payment?
ROSE: Well, I - I should talk to my... companion.
JACK: Companion?
ROSE: Yeah, I should really be getting back to him.
JACK: Him?
ROSE: Do you have the time?
ROSE: Okay, that was flash. Th-- that was on the flash side.
JACK: So... when you say 'companion', just how disappointed should I be?
ROSE: Okay... we're standing in midair...
JACK: Mm-hm.
ROSE: On a spaceship... during a German air raid... do you really think now's a good time to be coming on to me...?
JACK: Perhaps not.
ROSE: Well, it was just a suggestion.
JACK: Do you like Glenn Miller?
JACK: It's 1941. The height of the London Blitz. The height of the German Bombing Campaign. And something else has fallen on London - a fully equipped Chula Warship. The last one in existence...
JACK: ... armed to the teeth. And I know where it is. Because I parked it.
JACK: If the Agency can name the right price, I can get it for you. But in two hours, a German bomb is gonna fall on it and destroy it forever. JACK: That's the deadline. That's the deal. And now, shall we discuss payment?
ROSE: Do you know what I think?
JACK: What?
ROSE: I think you were talking just there...
JACK: Two hours, the bomb falls. There'll be nothing left but dust and a crater.
ROSE: Promises, promises...
JACK: Are you listening to any of this?
ROSE: You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kind of freelancer.
JACK: Well, that's a little harsh. I like to think of myself as a criminal.
ROSE: I bet you do!
JACK: So, this companion of yours - does he handle the business?
ROSE: Well, I delegate a lot of that, yeah.
JACK: Well, maybe we should go find him.
ROSE: And how're you gonna do that?
JACK: Easy. I'll do a scan for alien tech.
ROSE: Finally, a PROFESSIONAL.
NANCY: The bomb's under that tarpaulin. They put the fence up over night. See that building? The hospital.
NINTH DOCTOR: What about it?
NANCY: That's where the doctor is.
NANCY: You should talk to him.
NINTH DOCTOR: For now, I'm more interested in getting in there.
NANCY: Talk to the doctor first.
NINTH DOCTOR: Why?
NANCY: 'Cos then maybe you won't wanna get inside.
NINTH DOCTOR: Where're you going?
NANCY: There was a lot of food in that house. I've got mouths to feed. Should be safe enough now.
NINTH DOCTOR: Can I ask you a question? Who did you lose?
NANCY: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: The way you look after all those kids. It's 'cos you lost somebody, isn't it? You're doing all this to make up for it.
NANCY: My little brother. Jamie. One night I went out looking for food. Same night that thing fell. I told him not to follow me - told him it was dangerous, but he just... he just didn't like being on his own.
NINTH DOCTOR: What happened?
NANCY: In the middle of an air raid? What do you THINK happened?
NINTH DOCTOR: Amazing.
NANCY: What is?
NINTH DOCTOR: 1941.
NINTH DOCTOR: Right now, not very far from here, a German war machine is rolling up the map of Europe. Country after country, falling like dominoes. Nothing can stop it. Nothing. Until one, tiny, damp little island says 'no'. 'No'. Not here. A mouse in front of a lion.
NINTH DOCTOR: You're amazing, the lot of you. Dunno what you do to Hitler, but you frighten the hell out of me. Off you go then... do what you've gotta do. Save the world.
DR CONSTANTINE: You'll find them everywhere. Every bed in every ward. Hundreds of them.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, I saw. Why are they still wearing gas masks?
DR CONSTANTINE: They're not. Who are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm, uh... are you the doctor?
DR CONSTANTINE: Doctor Constantine. And you are?
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy sent me.
DR CONSTANTINE: Nancy? That means you must've been asking about the bomb.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes.
DR CONSTANTINE: What do you know about it?
NINTH DOCTOR: Nothing. Why I was asking. What do you know?
DR CONSTANTINE: Only what it's done.
NINTH DOCTOR: These people - were they all caught up in the blast?
DR CONSTANTINE: None of them were.
NINTH DOCTOR: You're very sick.
DR CONSTANTINE: Dying, I should think - I just haven't been able to find the time. Are you a doctor?
NINTH DOCTOR: I have my moments.
DR CONSTANTINE: Have you examined any of them, yet?
NINTH DOCTOR: No.
DR CONSTANTINE: Don't touch the flesh.
NINTH DOCTOR: Which one?
DR CONSTANTINE: ANY one.
DR CONSTANTINE: Conclusions?
NINTH DOCTOR: Massive head trauma, mostly to the left side... Partial collapse of the chest cavity, mostly to the right. There's some scarring on the back of the hand and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh but I can't see any burns.
DR CONSTANTINE: Examine another one.
NINTH DOCTOR: This isn't possible.
DR CONSTANTINE: Examine another.
NINTH DOCTOR: This isn't possible!
DR CONSTANTINE: No.
NINTH DOCTOR: They've all got the same injuries!
DR CONSTANTINE: Yes.
NINTH DOCTOR: Exactly the same.
DR CONSTANTINE: Yes.
NINTH DOCTOR: Identical, all of them. Right down to the scar on the back of the hand.
NINTH DOCTOR: How did this happen? How did it start?
DR CONSTANTINE: When that bomb dropped, there was just one victim.
NINTH DOCTOR: Dead?
DR CONSTANTINE: At first. His injuries were truly dreadful. By the following morning, every doctor and nurse who had treated him - who had touched him - had those exact same injuries. By the morning after that, every patient in the same ward had the exact same injuries. Within a week, the entire hospital. Physical injuries - as plague. Can you explain that? What would you say was the cause of death?
NINTH DOCTOR: The head trauma.
DR CONSTANTINE: No.
NINTH DOCTOR: Asphyxiation.
DR CONSTANTINE: No.
NINTH DOCTOR: The collapse of the chest cavity--
DR CONSTANTINE: No.
NINTH DOCTOR: All right. What was the cause of death?
DR CONSTANTINE: There wasn't one.
DR CONSTANTINE: They're not dead.
DR CONSTANTINE: It's all right. They're harmless. They just... sort of, sit there. No heartbeat, no life signs of any kind. They just... don't die.
NINTH DOCTOR: And they've just been left here? Nobody's DOING anything?
DR CONSTANTINE: I try and make them comfortable, what else is there?
NINTH DOCTOR: Just you? You're the only one here?
DR CONSTANTINE: Before this war began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither. But I am still a doctor.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah. Know the feeling.
DR CONSTANTINE: I suspect the plan is to blow up the hospital and blame it on a German bomb.
NINTH DOCTOR: Probably too late.
DR CONSTANTINE: No. They are isolated cases, but... isolated cases breaking out all over London...
DR CONSTANTINE: Stay back, stay back. Listen to me... top floor. Room 802, that's where they took the first victim - the one from the crash site. And you must find Nancy again.
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy?
DR CONSTANTINE: It was her brother. She knows more than she's saying. She won't tell me, but she mi-- mi--
DR CONSTANTINE: M... mu... mee...
DR CONSTANTINE: Are... you... my... mum-my?
JACK: Hello?
ROSE: Hello?
JACK: Hello?
JACK: Good evening. Hope I'm not interrupting - Jack Harkness. I've been hearing all about you on the way over.
ROSE: He knows. I had to tell him about us being Time Agents.
JACK: And it's a real pleasure to meet you, Mr Spock.
NINTH DOCTOR: Mr Spock?
ROSE: What was I supposed to say, you don't have a name! Don't you ever get tired of 'Doctor'? Doctor who?
NINTH DOCTOR: Nine centuries in, I'm coping. Where've you been? We're in the middle of the London Blitz, it's not a good time for a stroll.
ROSE: Who's strolling? I went by barrage balloon. Only way to see an air raid.
NINTH DOCTOR: What?!
ROSE: Listen, what's a Chula warship?
NINTH DOCTOR: Chula?
THE CHILD: Please, mummy. Please let me in.
THE CHILD: I'm scared of the bombs, mummy. Please, mummy...
THE CHILD: Mummy... mum-my...
JACK: This just isn't possible. How could this happen?
NINTH DOCTOR: What kind of Chula ship landed here?
JACK: What?
ROSE: He said it was a warship. He stole it. Parked it somewhere out there, somewhere a bomb's gonna fall on it - unless WE make him an offer.
NINTH DOCTOR: What kind of warship?
JACK: Does it matter? It's got nothing to do with this!
NINTH DOCTOR: This started at the bomb site. It's got EVERYTHING to do with it. What kind of warship?
JACK: An ambulance! Look.
JACK: That's what you chased through the Time Vortex. It's space junk. I wanted to kid you it was valuable. It's empty. I made sure of it. Nothing but a shell. I threw it at you. Saw your time travel vehicle - love the retro look, by the way, nice panels - threw you the bait--
ROSE: Bait?
JACK: I wanted to sell it to you and then destroy it before you found out it was junk.
ROSE: You said it was a WAR ship.
JACK: They have ambulances in wars. It was a con. I was conning you - that's what I am, I'm a con man. I thought you were Time Agents but you're not, are you?
ROSE: Just a couple more freelancers.
JACK: Ahh... should've known. The way you guys are blending in with the local colour - I mean, Flag Girl was bad enough, but U-Boat Captain?
JACK: Anyway... whatever's happening here has got NOTHING to do with that ship.
ROSE: What IS happening here, Doctor?
NINTH DOCTOR: Human DNA's being rewritten... by an idiot.
ROSE: What d'you mean?
NINTH DOCTOR: I dunno - some kind of virus. It's converting human beings into these things. But why? What's the point?
THE CHILD: Mummy? Where's my mummy? Mummy?
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
ROSE: What's happening?
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't know.
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NANCY: It's me. Nancy!
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't let them touch you.
ROSE: What happens if they touch us?
NINTH DOCTOR: You're looking at it.
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
NANCY: It's Nancy. Your sister.
NANCY: You're dead, Jamie. You're dead!
THE CHILD: Mum-my... mum-my...
