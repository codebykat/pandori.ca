ROSE: Bye!
JACKIE: See you later!
ROSE: Bye!
LOUDSPEAKER: This is a customer announcement; the store will be closing in five minutes. Thank you.
SECURITY GUARD: Oi!
ROSE: Wilson?
ROSE: Wilson, I've got the lottery money. Wilson?
ROSE: You there? Look, I can't hang about 'cause they're closing the shop. Wilson! 
ROSE: Uhh, come on!
ROSE: Hello? Hello, Wilson, it's Rose. Hello? Wil- Wilson?
ROSE: Wilson? Wilson?
ROSE: Is that someone mucking about?
ROSE: Who is it?
ROSE: Heh… you got me, very funny.
ROSE: Right, I've got the joke! Whose idea was this? Was it Derek's?
ROSE: Derek, is this you?
NINTH DOCTOR: Run.
ROSE: You pulled his arm off!
NINTH DOCTOR: Yep!
NINTH DOCTOR: Plastic.
ROSE: Very clever, nice trick! Who were they then, students? Is this a student thing or what?
NINTH DOCTOR: Why would they be students?
ROSE: I don't know...
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, you said it!
ROSE: 'Cause… to get that many people dressed up and being silly... they gotta be students.
NINTH DOCTOR: That makes sense! Well done.
ROSE: Thanks.
NINTH DOCTOR: They're not students.
ROSE: Whoever they are, when Wilson finds them, he's gonna call the police.
NINTH DOCTOR: Who's Wilson?
ROSE: Chief electrician.
NINTH DOCTOR: Wilson's dead.
ROSE: That's just not funny, that's sick!
NINTH DOCTOR: Hold on!
NINTH DOCTOR: Mind your eyes.
ROSE: I've had enough of this now!
ROSE: Who are you, then? Who's that lot down there? I said, who are they?
NINTH DOCTOR: They're made of plastic. Living plastic creatures. They're being controlled by a relay device in the roof. Which would be a great big problem if I didn't have this.
NINTH DOCTOR: So!
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm going to go up there and blow them up, and I might well die in the process. But don't worry about me, no. Go home, go on! Go and have your lovely beans on toast.
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't tell anyone about this, because if you do, you'll get them killed.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, by the way, what's your name?
ROSE: Rose.
NINTH DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life.
TAXI DRIVER: Watch it!
REPORTER: The whole of Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire. Earlier reports in the...
JACKIE: I know, it's on the telly! It's everywhere! She's lucky to be alive!
JACKIE: Honestly, it's aged her. Skin like an old bible. Walking in now you'd think I was her daughter! Oh and here's himself...
MICKEY: I've been phoning your mobile, you could've been dead! It's on the news and everything! I can't believe that your shop went up!
ROSE: I'm alright, honestly, I'm fine! Don't make a fuss.
MICKEY: Well, what happened?
ROSE: I don't know!
MICKEY: What was it though, what caused it?
ROSE: I wasn't in the shop, I was outside, I didn't see anything...
JACKIE: It's Debbie on the other end, she knows a man from the Mirror - five hundred quid for an interview!
ROSE: Oh that's brilliant! Give it here!
JACKIE: Well, you've gotta find some way of making money. Your job's kaput and I'm not bailing you out.
JACKIE: Beth! She's alive!
JACKIE: I tell ya, sue for compensation! She was within seconds of death...
MICKEY: What're you drinking? Tea?? No no no, that's no good, that's no good. You're in shock, you need something stronger.
ROSE: Why?
MICKEY: You deserve a proper drink, you and me, we're going down the pub, my treat. How about it?
ROSE: Is there a match on?
MICKEY: I'm just thinking about you, babe!
ROSE: There's a match on, ain't there.
MICKEY: Well, that's not the point. We could catch the last five minutes.
ROSE: Go on then. I'm fine, really. Go. Get rid of that...
MICKEY: Buh Bye!
ROSE: Bye!
REPORTER: ... fire then spread throughout the store... there is very little chance of saving the infrastructure...
JACKIE: There's no point in getting up, sweetheart. You've got no job to go to.
JACKIE: There's Finches... you could try them. They've always got jobs.
ROSE: Oh, great. The butchers.
JACKIE: Well it might do you good! That shop was giving you airs and graces. And I'm not joking about getting compensation - you've had genuine shock and trauma! Arianna got two thousand quid off the council just because the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek! I know she is Greek, but that's not the point - it's a valid claim.
ROSE: Mum, you're such a liar, I told you to nail that cat flap down. We're going to get strays!
JACKIE: I did it weeks back!
ROSE: No, you thought about it!
NINTH DOCTOR: What're you doing here?
ROSE: I live here.
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, what do you do that for?
ROSE: Because I do! And I'm only at home because someone blew up my job.
NINTH DOCTOR: Must've got the wrong signal. You're not plastic, are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: No, bonehead. Bye, then!
ROSE: You, inside. Right now.
JACKIE: Who is it?
ROSE: It's about last night, he's part of the inquiry. Give us 10 minutes.
JACKIE: She deserves compensation.
NINTH DOCTOR: Huh, we're talking millions.
JACKIE: I'm in my dressing gown.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, you are.
JACKIE: There's a strange man in my bedroom.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, there is.
JACKIE: Well, anything could happen.
NINTH DOCTOR: No.
ROSE: Don't mind the mess. Do you want a coffee?
NINTH DOCTOR: Might as well, thanks! Just milk.
ROSE: We should go to the police. Seriously. Both of us.
NINTH DOCTOR: That won't last, he's gay and she's an alien.
ROSE: I'm not blaming you, even if it was just some sort of joke that went wrong.
NINTH DOCTOR: Sad ending.
ROSE: They said on the news they'd found a body.
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose Tyler.
NINTH DOCTOR: Ahh, could've been worse!
NINTH DOCTOR: Look at me ears.
ROSE: All the same, he was nice. Nice bloke.
NINTH DOCTOR: Luck be a lady!
ROSE: Well anyway if we are going to go to the police, I want to know what I'm saying.
ROSE: I want you to explain everything.
NINTH DOCTOR: Maybe not.
NINTH DOCTOR: What's that then? You got a cat?
ROSE: No…
ROSE: We did have, but there's these strays, they come in off the estate...
ROSE: I told Mickey to chuck that out...
ROSE: Honestly, give a man a plastic hand... anyway, I don't even know your name, Doctor... what was it?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's alright, I've stopped it. There you go, you see?
NINTH DOCTOR: Harmless.
ROSE: Do you think?
NINTH DOCTOR: Ow!
ROSE: Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes I can. Here I am, this is me, swanning off. See ya!
ROSE: That arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
NINTH DOCTOR: Ten out of ten for observation.
ROSE: You can't just walk away, that's not fair! You've got to tell me what's going on.
NINTH DOCTOR: No I don't.
ROSE: Alright then. I'll go to the police. I'll tell everyone. You said, if I did that, I'd get people killed. So, your choice. Tell me, or I'll start talking.
NINTH DOCTOR: Is that supposed to sound tough?
ROSE: Sort of.
NINTH DOCTOR: Doesn't work.
ROSE: Who are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: I told you! The Doctor.
ROSE: Yeah. But Doctor what?
NINTH DOCTOR: Just the Doctor.
ROSE: The Doctor.
NINTH DOCTOR: Hello!
ROSE: Is that supposed to sound impressive?
NINTH DOCTOR: Sort of.
ROSE: Come on. You can tell me. I've seen enough. Are you the police?
NINTH DOCTOR: No. I was just passing through. I'm a long way from home.
ROSE: But what have I done wrong? How comes those plastic things keep coming after me?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh! Suddenly the entire world revolves around you! You were just an accident, you got in the way, that's all.
ROSE: It tried to kill me!
NINTH DOCTOR: It was after me, not you! Last night, in the shop, I was there, you blundered it. Almost ruined the whole thing. This morning, I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down... the only reason it fixed on you is that you met me.
ROSE: So, what you're saying is, the entire world revolves around you.
NINTH DOCTOR: Sort of, yeah.
ROSE: You're full of it!
NINTH DOCTOR: Sort of, yeah.
ROSE: But, all this plastic stuff - who else knows about it?
NINTH DOCTOR: No one.
ROSE: What, you're on your own?
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed, and watch telly! When all the time, underneath you, there's a war going on!
ROSE: Okay, start from the beginning. If you're gonna go with this living plastic, and I don't even believe that, but if we do... how did you kill it?
NINTH DOCTOR: The thing controlling it projects life into the arm. I cut off the signal, dead.
ROSE: So that's radio control?
NINTH DOCTOR: Thought control.
NINTH DOCTOR: Are you alright?
ROSE: Yeah. So, who's controlling it then?
NINTH DOCTOR: Long story.
ROSE: But what's it all for? I mean, shop window dummies... what's that about? Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
NINTH DOCTOR: No.
ROSE: I know.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not a price war.
NINTH DOCTOR: They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you. Do you believe me?
ROSE: No.
NINTH DOCTOR: But you're still listening.
ROSE: Really though, Doctor. Tell me - who are you?
NINTH DOCTOR: Do you know like we were saying? About the Earth revolving?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's like when you were a kid. The first time they tell you the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it because everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it.
NINTH DOCTOR: The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour, and the entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty-seven thousand miles an hour. And I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me. Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
NINTH DOCTOR: That's who I am. Now, forget me, Rose Tyler.
NINTH DOCTOR: Go home.
MICKEY: Yahey, there's my woman!
MICKEY: Kit off!
ROSE: Shut up.
ROSE: Mwah!
MICKEY: Coffee?
ROSE: Yeah, only if you wash the mug. And I don't mean rinse, I mean wash. Can I use your computer?
MICKEY: Yeah. Any excuse to get in the bedroom.
MICKEY: Don't read my emails!
ROSE: You're not coming in! He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
MICKEY: Yeah but who told you that? He did. That's exactly what an Internet lunatic murderer would say.
ROSE: Uh, hello, I've come to see Clive? We've been emailing.
BOY: Dad! It's one of your nutters!
CLIVE: Sorry. Hello. You must be Rose. I'm Clive. Obviously!
ROSE: I better tell you now - my boyfriend's waiting in the car, just in case you're going to kill me!
CLIVE: No, good point. No murders.
CAROLINE: Who is it?
CLIVE: Oh it's something to do with the Doctor! She's been reading the website. Please come through, I'm in the shed.
CAROLINE: She? She read a website about the Doctor? She's a she?
CLIVE: A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it to you. People might intercept it, if you know what I mean. If you dig deep enough - keep a lively mind - this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place. Political diaries, conspiracy theories. Even ghost stories. No first name, no last name. Just 'The Doctor'. Always The Doctor. And the title seems to have been passed down from father to son, it appears to be an inheritance. That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
ROSE: Yeah.
CLIVE: I tracked it down to the Washington public archive last year. The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
CLIVE: November the 22nd, 1963. The assassination of President Kennedy.
ROSE: Must be his father...
CLIVE: Going further back... April 1912.
CLIVE: This is a photo of the Daniels family, Southampton. And friend.
CLIVE: This was taken the day before they were due to sail off for the New World. On the Titanic. And for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived. And...
CLIVE: 1883. Another Doctor. And look - the same lineage. He's identical. This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra on the very day Krakatoa exploded. The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history. When disaster comes, he's there. He has a storm in his wake. And he has one constant companion.
ROSE: Who's that?
CLIVE: Death.
CLIVE: If the Doctor's back... if you've seen him, Rose... then one thing's for certain - we're all in danger.
MICKEY: Come on then!
CLIVE: If he's singled you out... if the Doctor's making house calls... then God help you.
ROSE: Who is he? Who do you think he is?
CLIVE: I think he's the same man. I think he's immortal. I think he's an alien from another world.
ROSE: Alright! He's a nutter! Off his head! Complete online conspiracy freak. You win! Oof.
ROSE: What're we going to do tonight? I fancy a pizza.
MICKEY: Pizzaaa! P-p-p-pizza!
ROSE: ... or a Chinese ...
MICKEY: Pizza!
ROSE: Do you think I should try the hospital? Suki said they had a few jobs going in the canteen. That's it then... dishing out chips... I could do A Levels...
ROSE: I dunno. It's all Jimmy Stone's fault. I only left school because of him, and look where he ended up. What do you think?
MICKEY: So, where did you meet this Doctor?
ROSE: I'm sorry, wasn't I talking about me for a second?
MICKEY: Because, I reckon it started back at the shop, am I right? Is he something to do with that?
ROSE: No…
MICKEY: Come on.
ROSE: Sort of.
MICKEY: What was he doing there?
ROSE: I'm not going on about him, Mickey, I'm not, because, I know it sounds daft but... I don't think he's safe. I think he's dangerous.
MICKEY: But you can trust me sweetheart! 
MICKEY: Babe, sugar, darling, sugar.
MICKEY: You can tell me anything. Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning, and I can help you, Rose. Because that's all I really wanna do, sweetheart, babe, sugar, sweetheart.
ROSE: What're you doing that for?
WAITER: Your champagne.
MICKEY: We didn't order any champagne.
MICKEY: Where's the Doctor?
WAITER: Ma'am. Your champagne.
ROSE: It's not ours... Mickey, what is it? What's wrong?
MICKEY: I need to find out how much you know, so where is he?
WAITER: Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
MICKEY: Look, we didn't order i--
MICKEY: Ah. Gotcha.
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't mind me. I'm just toasting the happy couple. On the house!
MICKEY: Anyway.
MICKEY: Don't think that's gonna stop me.
ROSE: Everyone out! Out now!
ROSE: Get out! Get out! Get out!
ROSE: Open the gate! Use that tube thing, come on!
NINTH DOCTOR: What, this? This is a sonic screwdriver.
ROSE: Use it!
NINTH DOCTOR: Nah. Tell ya what, let's go in here.
ROSE: We can't hide inside a wooden box!
ROSE: It's gonna get us! Doctor!
ROSE: It's gonna follow us!
NINTH DOCTOR: The assembled hoards of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door, and believe me, they've tried. Now, shut up a minute.
NINTH DOCTOR: You see, the arm is too simple, but the head's perfect.
NINTH DOCTOR: I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source. Right.
NINTH DOCTOR: Where do you want to start?
ROSE: Um… the inside's bigger than the outside?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes.
ROSE: It's alien.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yup.
ROSE: Are you alien?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes.
NINTH DOCTOR: Is that alright?
ROSE: Yeah.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
NINTH DOCTOR: That's okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us.
ROSE: Did they kill him? Mickey? Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh… didn't think of that.
ROSE: He's my boyfriend. You pulled off his head - they copied him and you didn't even think? And now you're just going to let him melt?!
NINTH DOCTOR: Melt?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, no no no no no NO!
ROSE: What're you doing?!
NINTH DOCTOR: Reviving the signal, it's fading! Wait I've got it...
NINTH DOCTOR: No No No No No No NO!
NINTH DOCTOR: Almost there! Almost there! Here we go!
ROSE: You can't go out there, it's not safe!
NINTH DOCTOR: I lost the signal, I got so close.
ROSE: We've moved! Does it fly?
NINTH DOCTOR: Disappears there, reappears here, you wouldn't understand.
ROSE: But if we're somewhere else, what about that headless thing? It's still on the loose.
NINTH DOCTOR: It melted with the head, are you going to witter on all night?
ROSE: I'll have to tell his mother...
ROSE: Mickey! I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him, again!
ROSE: You were right, you are alien.
NINTH DOCTOR: Look, if I did forget some kid called Mickey--
ROSE: Yeah, he's not a kid.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's because I'm trying to save the life of every stupid ape blundering on top of this planet, alright??
ROSE: Alright!
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes! It is!
ROSE: If you are an alien, then how comes you sound like you're from the North?
NINTH DOCTOR: Lots of planets have a North.
ROSE: What's a police public call box?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's a telephone box from the 1950s.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's a disguise.
ROSE: Okay. And this living plastic, what's it got against us?
NINTH DOCTOR: Nothing, it loves you. You've got such a good planet. Lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins in the air... perfect. Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs. It's food stock was destroyed in the war, all its protein plants rotted, so Earth... dinner!
ROSE: Any way of stopping it?
NINTH DOCTOR: Anti-plastic!
ROSE: Anti-plastic…
NINTH DOCTOR: Anti-plastic! But first I've got to find it. How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
ROSE: Hold on... hide what?
NINTH DOCTOR: The transmitter. The Consciousness is controlling every single piece of plastic so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal.
ROSE: What's it look like?
NINTH DOCTOR: Like a transmitter. Round and massive, slap bang in the middle of London.
NINTH DOCTOR: A huge circular metal structure... like a dish...
NINTH DOCTOR: ... like a wheel. Close to where we're standing. Must be completely invisible.
NINTH DOCTOR: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: What is it? What?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh… fantastic!
NINTH DOCTOR: Think of it. Plastic, all over the world. Every artificial thing waiting to come alive. The shop window dummies, the phones, the wires, the cables...
ROSE: The breast implants...
NINTH DOCTOR: Still, we've found the transmitter. The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
ROSE: What about down here?
NINTH DOCTOR: Looks good to me.
NINTH DOCTOR: The Nestene Consciousness, that's it, inside the vat. A living, plastic creature.
ROSE: Well, then. Tip in your anti-plastic and let's go.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm not here to kill it. I've got to give it a chance.
NINTH DOCTOR: I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract. According to convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
NESTENE: *flobble*
NINTH DOCTOR: Thank you. That I might have permission to approach.
ROSE: Oh, my God! Mickey! It's okay! It's alright!
MICKEY: That thing down there, the liquid, Rose - it can talk!
ROSE: You're stinking! Doctor, they kept him alive!
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah, that was always a possibility. Keep him alive to maintain the copy.
ROSE: You knew that and you never said?
NINTH DOCTOR: Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you?
NINTH DOCTOR: Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilization by means of warped, shunt technology. So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that you shunt off?
NESTENE: *globber*
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh don't give me that, it's an invasion! Plain and simple! Don't talk about constitutional rights!
NINTH DOCTOR: I - am - talking! This planet is just starting. These stupid little people have only just learnt how to walk, but they're capable of so much more. I'm asking you on their behalf - please, just go.
ROSE: Doctor!
NINTH DOCTOR: That was just insurance! I wasn't going to use it.
NESTENE: *globber*
NINTH DOCTOR: I was not attacking you. I'm here to help. I'm not your enemy. I swear, I'm not... what do you mean?
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, oh no - honestly, no! Yes, that's my ship.
NESTENE: *roar*
NINTH DOCTOR: That's not true. I should know, I was there. I fought in the war - it wasn't my fault! I couldn't save your world! I couldn't save any of them!
ROSE: What's it doing?!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's the TARDIS! The Nestene has identified its superior technology - it's terrified! It's going to the final base. It's starting the invasion! Get out, Rose! Just leg it! Now!
ROSE: Mum?!
JACKIE: Oh, there you are, I was just gonna phone. You can get compensation. I said so. I've got this document thing off the police - don't thank me!
ROSE: Where are you, mum?
JACKIE: I'm in town!
ROSE: Go home! Just go home, right now!
JACKIE: Darling, you're breaking up, look, I'm just going to do a bit of late night shopping. I'll see you later. Ta!
ROSE: Mum?! Mum!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's the activation signal! It's transmitting!
ROSE: The end of the world...
CLIVE: There's no point creating a spreadsheet if you're going to spend summer money in winter months.
CAROLINE: Oh my God! I thought they were dummies! I nearly had a heart-attack!
CLIVE: It's true. Everything I read, all the stories! It's all true!
NINTH DOCTOR: Get out, Rose! Just get out! Run!
ROSE: The stairs have gone!
ROSE: I haven't got the key!
MICKEY: We're gonna die!
MICKEY: Just leave him!
MICKEY: There's nothing you can do!
ROSE: I've got no A Levels.
ROSE: No job...
ROSE: No future.
ROSE: But I tell you what I have got. Jericho Street Junior School under 7s gymnastic team.
ROSE: I got the bronze!
NINTH DOCTOR: Now we're in trouble.
JACKIE: Rose! Rose! Don't go out of the house, it's not safe!
JACKIE: There were all of these things! And they were shooting! And they--
JACKIE: Hello? Hello?
ROSE: A fat lot of good you were!
NINTH DOCTOR: Nestene Consciousness?
NINTH DOCTOR: Easy.
ROSE: You were useless in there. You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, I would. Thank you. Right then! I'll be off! Unless, uh... I don't know... you could come with me.
NINTH DOCTOR: This box isn't just a London hopper, you know, it goes anywhere in the universe free of charge.
MICKEY: Don't! He's an alien! He's a thing!
NINTH DOCTOR: He's not invited. What do you think? You could stay here and fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go, uh... anywhere.
ROSE: Is it always this dangerous?
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah.
ROSE: Yeah, I can't... I've um... gotta go and find my mum and um... someone's gotta look after this stupid lump...
ROSE: So…
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay. See you around.
ROSE: Come on, let's go.
ROSE: C'mon… come on...
NINTH DOCTOR: By the way - did I mention, it also travels in time?
ROSE: Thanks.
MICKEY: Thanks for what?
ROSE: Exactly.
