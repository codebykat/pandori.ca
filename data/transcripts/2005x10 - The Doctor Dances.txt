NINTH DOCTOR: Go to your room.
NINTH DOCTOR: Go to your room!
NINTH DOCTOR: I mean it! I am very, very angry with you. I am very, VERY cross! Go - to - your - ROOM!
He points violently in no particular direction, and miraculously, all the gas-mask people turn meekly away.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm really glad that worked. Those would've been TERRIBLE last words.
NANCY: Jamie…
ROSE: Why are they all wearing gas masks? 
JACK: They're not. Those masks are flesh and bone. 
NINTH DOCTOR: How was your con supposed to work?
JACK: Simple enough, really. Find some harmless piece of space-junk... let the nearest Time Agent track it back to Earth. Convince him it's valuable, name a price. When he's put 50% up front - oops! A German bomb falls on it, destroys it forever. He never gets to see what he's paid for. Never knows he's been had. I buy him a drink with his own money, and we discuss dumb luck. The perfect self-cleaning con. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah. Perfect.
JACK: The London Blitz is great for self-cleaners - Pompeii's nice if you want to make a vacation of it though, but you've got to set your alarm for volcano day.
JACK: Getting a hint of disapproval.
NINTH DOCTOR: Take a look around the room. This is what your 'harmless piece of space-junk' did.
JACK: It was a burnt-out medical transporter - it was empty. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose.
ROSE: We getting out of here? 
NINTH DOCTOR: We're going upstairs.
JACK: I even programmed the flight computer so it wouldn't land on anything living - I harmed no-one! I don't know what's happening here, but believe me - I had nothing to do with it.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'll tell you what's happening. You forgot to set your alarm clock. It's volcano day.
ROSE: What's that?
JACK: The all-clear. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I wish. 
NANCY: I thought you were Jamie!
BOY: Dad! Dad!
NANCY: Get your hands off me!
MRS LLOYD: Oi! You! Get in! Get in!
JACK: Mr Spock?
ROSE: Doctor? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Have you got a blaster?
JACK: Sure!
NINTH DOCTOR: The night your space-junk landed, someone was hurt. This was where they were taken. 
ROSE: What happened?
NINTH DOCTOR: Let's find out. Get it open. 
ROSE: What's wrong with your sonic screwdriver?
NINTH DOCTOR: Nothing. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Sonic blaster, 51st century. Weapon Factories of Villengard? 
JACK: You've been to the factories? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Once.
JACK: Well, they're gone now. Destroyed. The main reactor went critical. Vapourized the lot. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Like I said - once. There's a banana grove there, now. I like bananas. Bananas are good. 
ROSE: Nice blast pattern.
JACK: Digital. 
ROSE: Squareness gun.
JACK: Yeah.
ROSE: I like it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What d'you think?
JACK: SOMETHING got out of here... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah. And?
JACK: Something powerful. Angry. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Powerful and angry.
JACK: A child? I suppose this explains 'mummy'. 
ROSE: How could a child do this?
DR CONSTANTINE: Do you know where you are?
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? 
DR CONSTANTINE: Are you aware of what's around you? Can you... see?
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? 
DR CONSTANTINE: What do you want? Do you know--
THE CHILD: I want my mummy. Are you my mummy? I want my mummy! Are you my mummy? 
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? Mummy? Mummy?
ROSE: Doctor, I've heard this voice before. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Me too.
THE CHILD: Mummy?
ROSE: Always, "Are you my mummy?". Like he doesn't know.
THE CHILD: Mummy? 
ROSE: Why doesn't he know?
THE CHILD: Are you there, mummy? Mummy?
MR LLOYD: The police are on their way. I PAY for the food on this table. The sweat on my brow, that food is. The sweat on my brow. Anything else you'd like? I've got a whole house here, anything else you'd like to help yourself to? 
NANCY: Yeah. I'd like some wire cutters, please. 
NANCY: Something that can cut through barbed wire. Oh, and a torch. Don't look like that, Mr Lloyd. I know you've got plenty of tools in here. I've been watching this house for ages. And I'd like another look round your kitchen cupboards. I was in a hurry the first time. I wanna see if there's anything I missed.
MR LLOYD: The food on this table--
NANCY: It's an awful lot of food, isn't it, Mr Lloyd?
NANCY: A lot more than on anyone else's table. Half this street thinks your missus must be messing about with Mr. Avistock - the butcher. But she's not, is she? You are. 
NANCY: Wire cutters. Torch. Food. And I'd like to use your bathroom before I leave, please. Oh, look... there's the sweat on your brow.
THE CHILD: Mummy? Please, mummy? Mummy?
ROSE: Doctor?
NINTH DOCTOR: Can you sense it?
JACK: Sense what? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Coming out of the walls, can you feel it? 
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: Funny little human brains, how do you get around in those things? 
ROSE: When he's stressed, he likes to insult species. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, I'm thinking. 
ROSE: Cuts himself shaving, does half an hour in life forms he's cleverer than... 
NINTH DOCTOR: There are these children living rough around the bomb site. They come out during air-raids looking for food. 
THE CHILD: Mummy, please?
NINTH DOCTOR: Suppose they were there when this thing - whatever it was - landed?
JACK: It was a med-ship. It was harmless.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, you keep saying. 'Harmless'. Suppose one of them was affected - altered? 
ROSE: Altered how?
THE CHILD: I'm here!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's afraid. Terribly afraid, and powerful. It doesn't know it yet, but it will do. It's got the power of a god, and I just sent it to its room. 
ROSE: Doctor...
THE CHILD: I'm here. Can't you see me?
ROSE: What's that noise? 
NINTH DOCTOR: End of the tape. It ran out about 30 seconds ago. 
THE CHILD: I'm here, now. Can't you see me?
NINTH DOCTOR: I sent it to its room. THIS is its room. 
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? Mummy?
ROSE: Doctor? 
JACK: Okay... on my signal... make for the door. NOW!
NINTH DOCTOR: Go! Now! Don't drop the banana! 
JACK: Why not?!
NINTH DOCTOR: Good source of potassium!
JACK: Give me that!
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
JACK: Digital rewind. Nice switch. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's from the Groves of Villengard. I thought it was appropriate. 
JACK: There's really a banana grove in the heart of Villengard and you did that? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Bananas are good. 
ROSE: Doctor! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's keeping us here so it can get at us.
JACK: It's controlling them?
NINTH DOCTOR: It IS them. It's every living thing in this hospital.
JACK: Okay. This can function as a sonic blaster, a sonic cannon, and a triple-enfolded sonic disrupter. Doc, what you got?
NINTH DOCTOR: A sonic, er... oh, never mind.
JACK: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that. 
JACK: Disrupter? Cannon? What? 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's sonic! Totally sonic! I am sonic-ed up!
JACK: A sonic WHAT?!
NINTH DOCTOR: SCREWDRIVER!
ROSE: Going down!
ROSE: Doctor, are you okay?
NINTH DOCTOR: Could've used a warning...!
ROSE: Ugh, the gratitude. 
JACK: Who has a sonic screwdriver?
NINTH DOCTOR: I do! 
ROSE: Light!
JACK: Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks "oohoo, this could be a little more sonic"? 
NINTH DOCTOR: What, you've never been bored?
ROSE: There's gotta be a light switch!
NINTH DOCTOR: Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?
JACK: Door.
JACK: Damn it!
JACK: It's the special features, they really drain the battery. 
ROSE: The battery?!
ROSE: That's so LAME.
JACK: I was gonna send for another one, but SOMEBODY'S gonna blow up the factory.
ROSE: Oh, I know - first day I met him, he blew my job up. That's practically how he communicates. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay, that door should hold it for a bit.
JACK: The door?! The WALL didn't stop it!
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, it's gotta FIND us first! Come on, we're not done yet! Assets, assets!
JACK: Well, I've got a banana, and at a pinch you could put up some shelves. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Window--
JACK: Barred, sheer drop outside. Seven stories.  
ROSE: And no other exits. 
JACK: Well, the assets conversation went in a flash, didn't it? 
NINTH DOCTOR: So, where'd you pick this one up, then? 
ROSE: Doctor… 
JACK: She was hanging from a barrage balloon, I had an invisible spaceship. I never stood a CHANCE.
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay, one, we want to get out of here. Two, we CAN'T get out of here. Have I missed anything? 
ROSE: Yeah… Jack just disappeared.
NANCY: Thought as much. What are all of you doing here? Different house every night, I told ya! 
JIM: We thought you were dead! Or you'd run off. 
ERNIE: I didn't. I KNEW you'd come back for us. 
ERNIE: Found that old thing in the junk. Thinks he can write now...
JIM: I'm writing a letter to me dad. 
ERNIE: You don't even know where your dad IS. And how're you gonna send it?
JIM: I dunno, stick it in an envelope? 
ERNIE: You can't even read or write.
JIM: I don't need to - I've got a machine! 
NANCY: Will you stop making that noise! 
NANCY: I'm sorry, Jim. On you go. You write a letter to your dad if you want to. 
ERNIE: I know we should've went somewhere else, but we need you, see. For the thinking. 
NANCY: And what if I wasn't here? What if one night, I didn't come back for you? There's a war on... people go out... they don't always come back. It happens. What would you do then?
ERNIE: Are they wire cutters?!
NANCY: I need you to think about that. SOMEONE'S gotta look after this lot!
ERNIE: Why? Are you going somewhere? 
NANCY: The bomb site. The one at the railway station. 
ERNIE: Why?
NANCY: The Child. That's where he was killed. That's where it all started. And I'm gonna find out how.
ERNIE: He'll get you! And then he'll come for us - he ALWAYS comes for us!
NANCY: No. Ernie, he doesn't. He always comes after ME. There are things I haven't told ya... things I CAN'T tell ya. As long as you're with me... you're in danger. Even now, sitting here, you're in danger because of me. 
ERNIE: You're the one that keeps us safe! 
NANCY: You think so, Ernie? Then answer this: Jim is sitting there right next to ya. So who's typing?
ERNIE: Is he coming? 
NANCY: Ernie... as long as you're with me... he's always coming. 
NANCY: Plenty of greens. And chew your food. 
ROSE: Okay, so he's vanished into thin air. Why is it always the GREAT looking ones who do that?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm making an effort not to be insulted. 
ROSE: I mean... men. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Okay. Thanks. That REALLY helped. 
JACK: Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me? 
JACK: I'm back on my ship.
JACK: Used the emergency teleport. Sorry I couldn't take you.
JACK: It's security-keyed to my molecular structure. I'm working on it - hang in there. 
NINTH DOCTOR: How're you speaking to us? 
JACK: Om-Com. I can call anything with a speaker grille.
NINTH DOCTOR: Now there's a coincidence. 
JACK: What is?
NINTH DOCTOR: The Child can Om-Com too. 
ROSE: It can?
NINTH DOCTOR: Anything with a speaker grille. Even the TARDIS phone.
ROSE: What, you mean the Child can phone us? 
THE CHILD: And I can hear you. Coming to find you. Coming to fiiiiind you. 
JACK: Doctor, can you hear that?
NINTH DOCTOR: Loud and clear. 
JACK: I'll try to block out the signal. Least I can do. 
THE CHILD: Coming to find you, mummy!
JACK: Remember this one, Rose? 
ROSE: Our song. 
ROSE: What you doing? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Trying to set up a resonation pattern in the concrete. Loosen the bars. 
ROSE: You don't think he's coming back, do ya? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Wouldn't bet my life. 
ROSE: Why don't you trust him?
NINTH DOCTOR: Why do you? 
ROSE: Saved my life. Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing.
ROSE: I trust him 'cos he's like you. Except with dating and dancing. 
ROSE: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: You just assume I'm... 
ROSE: What?
NINTH DOCTOR: You just assume that I don't... dance. 
ROSE: What, are you telling me you DO... dance? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nine hundred years old, me. I've been around a bit. I think you can assume that at some point I've DANCED.
ROSE: You?!
NINTH DOCTOR: Problem? 
ROSE: Doesn't the universe implode or something if you... dance? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, I've got the moves but I wouldn't want to boast. 
ROSE: You've got the moves? 
ROSE: Show me your moves.
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete. 
ROSE: Jack'll be back, he'll get us out. So come on - the world doesn't end 'cos the Doctor dances. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Barrage balloon?
ROSE: ... What? 
NINTH DOCTOR: You were hanging from a barrage balloon.
ROSE: Oh… yeah. About two minutes after you left me. Thousands of feet above London - middle of a German air-raid - Union Jack ALL over my chest.
NINTH DOCTOR: I've travelled with a lot of people, but you're setting new records for jeopardy-friendly. 
ROSE: Is this you dancing? 'Cos I've got notes.
NINTH DOCTOR: Hanging from a rope a thousand feet above London. Not a cut, not a bruise. 
ROSE: Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, we're calling him 'Captain Jack' now, are we?
ROSE: Well, his name's Jack and he's a captain... 
NINTH DOCTOR: He's not really a captain, Rose. 
ROSE: D'you know what I think? I think you're experiencing Captain envy.  
ROSE: You'll find your feet at the end of your legs. You may care to move them. 
NINTH DOCTOR: If ever he was a captain, he's been defrocked.
ROSE: Yeah? Shame I missed that.  JACK: Actually, I quit. Nobody takes my frock.
JACK: Most people notice when they've been teleported. You guys are so sweet. Sorry about the delay. I had to take the nav-com offline to override the teleport security.
NINTH DOCTOR: You can spend ten minutes overriding your own protocols? Maybe you should remember whose ship it is.
JACK: Oh, I do. She was GORGEOUS.
JACK: Like I told her - be back in five minutes.
NINTH DOCTOR: This is a Chula ship.
JACK: Yeah, just like that medical transporter. Only, this one IS dangerous.
ROSE: They're what fixed my hands up! Jack called 'em, um...
NINTH DOCTOR: Nanobots? Nanogenes.
ROSE: Nanogenes, yeah.
NINTH DOCTOR: Sub-atomic robots. There's millions of them in here, see? Burned my hand on the console when we landed - all better now. They activate when the bulk head's sealed. Check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws.
Rose beams. The Doctor banishes the nanogenes with a wave of his hand and turns to Jack.
NINTH DOCTOR: Take us to the crash site. I need to see your space junk.
JACK: As soon as I get the nav-com back online.
JACK: Make yourself comfortable. Carry on with whatever it was you were... ... doing.
NINTH DOCTOR: We were talking about dancing!
JACK: It didn't look like talking.
ROSE: Didn't feel like dancing.
ALGY: Halt! Don't move!
ROSE: So, you used to BE a Time Agent - now you're trying to con them? 
JACK: If it makes me sound any better, it's not for the money. 
ROSE: For what? 
JACK: Woke up one day when I was working for them - found they'd stolen two years of my memories. I'd like them back.
ROSE: They stole your memories? 
JACK: Two years of my life. No idea what I did.
JACK: Your friend over there doesn't trust me. And for all I know... he's right not to. 
JACK: Okay, we're good to go. 
JACK: Crash site? 
ALGY: As you were. Feeling any better? 
JENKINS: Just a turn, sir.
ALGY: Chain her up where Jenkins can keep an eye on her.
NANCY: No. Not in here. Not with him. 
ALGY: You shouldn't have broken in here if you didn't want to stay. 
NANCY: You don't understand. Not with HIM. 
ALGY: This is a restricted area, miss. 
ALGY: You're going to have to stay here for a bit. We're going to have to ask you a few questions.
SOLDIER: Found these, sir. 
ALGY: Very professional... little bit TOO professional. Didn't just drop in by accident then, did you?
NANCY: My little brother died here. I wanted to find out what killed him. 
ALGY: Take the men, check the fence for any other breaches and search the area. She may not have come alone. 
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.
NANCY: Please! Listen, you CAN'T leave me here.
ALGY: Watch her, Jenkins. 
JENKINS: Yes, mummy. 
ALGY: Jenkins! 
ALGY: Sorry - sir, I-- I don't know what's the matter with me. 
NANCY: Look... lock me up, fine. But not here. Please, ANYWHERE but here! 
JENKINS: You'll be alright, miss. I'm just a little...
JENKINS: Just a little... just a little... 
JENKINS: What's the MATTER with you?
NANCY: Please, let me go.
JENKINS: Why would I do that?
NANCY: 'Cos you've got a scar on the back of your hand.
JENKINS: Well, yes. But I don't see what that's got to do with anything.
NANCY: And you feel like you're gonna be sick, like something's forcing its way up your throat.
NANCY: I know because I've seen it before.
JENKINS: What's happening to me?
NANCY: In a minute, you won't BE you anymore. You won't even remember you. And unless you let me go, it's gonna happen to me too. PLEASE.
JENKINS: What're you talking about?
NANCY: What's your mother's name?
JENKINS: Matilda.
NANCY: You got a wife?
JENKINS: Yes.
NANCY: Wife's name?
NANCY: You got kids?
NANCY: What's YOUR name?
NANCY: Please. Let me go. It's too late for you, I'm sorry. But please, let me go.
JENKINS: What d'you meeee--- M-- muuummee....
JACK: There it is. Ay, they've got Algy on duty. Must be important. 
NINTH DOCTOR: We've gotta get past. 
ROSE: The words 'distract the guard' head in my general direction.
JACK: I don't think that'd be such a good idea. 
ROSE: Don't worry... I can handle it.
JACK: I've got to know Algy quite well since I've been in town. Trust me. You're not his type. I'll distract him. Don't wait up. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Relax, he's a 51st century guy. He's just a bit more flexible when it comes to dancing.
ROSE: HOW flexible?
NINTH DOCTOR: Well, by his time, you lot have spread out across half the galaxy. 
ROSE: Meaning? 
NINTH DOCTOR: So many species, so little time...
ROSE: What, that's what we do when we get out there? That's our mission? We seek new life, and... and...
NINTH DOCTOR: Dance.
JACK: Hey, tiger! How's it hanging? 
ALGY: Mummy?
JACK: Algy, old sport, it's me. 
ALGY: Mummy?
JACK: It's me, Jack. 
ALGY: Jack? Are you my... mummy? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Stay back!
JACK: You men! Stay away! 
NINTH DOCTOR: The effect's become airborne. Accelerating. 
ROSE: What's keeping US safe? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nothing. 
JACK: Ah, here they come again. 
ROSE: All we need. Didn't you say a bomb was gonna land... HERE?
NINTH DOCTOR: Never mind about that. If the contaminant's airborne now, there's hours left. 
JACK: For what?
NINTH DOCTOR: 'Til nothing. 'Til forever. For the entire human race. And can anyone else hear singing? 
NANCY: Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree tops, when the wind blows the cradle will rock...
NANCY: When the bough breaks the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, cradle and all.
NANCY: Rock-a-bye baby... ... on the tree tops, when the wind blows the cradle will rock...
JACK: You see? Just an ambulance. 
NANCY: That's an ambulance? 
ROSE: It's hard to explain, it's... it's from another world. 
JACK: They've been trying to get in.
NINTH DOCTOR: Of COURSE they have. 
NINTH DOCTOR: They think they've got their hands on Hitler's latest secret weapon. What're you doing?
JACK: Well, the sooner you see this thing is empty, the sooner you'll see I had nothing to do with it. 
JACK: Didn't happen last time. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It hadn't crashed last time. They're the emergency protocols. 
ROSE: Doctor, what IS that?
THE CHILD: Mummy?
ROSE: Doctor! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Captain, secure those gates! 
JACK: Why?
NINTH DOCTOR: Just do it! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy, how'd you get in here? 
NANCY: I cut the wire.
NINTH DOCTOR: Show Rose. Setting two thousand four hundred and twenty eight D. 
ROSE: What??
NINTH DOCTOR: Reattaches barbed wire. Go! 
NANCY: Who are you? Who are any of you? 
ROSE: You'd never believe me if I told ya. 
NANCY: You just told me that was an ambulance from another world. There are people running around with gas-mask heads calling for their mummies, and the sky's full of Germans dropping bombs on me. Tell me. Do you think there's anything left I couldn't believe? 
ROSE: We're time travelers from the future. 
NANCY: Mad, you are.
ROSE: We have a time travel machine - seriously! 
NANCY: It's not that. All right - you've got a time travel machine. I believe ya. Believe anything, me. But what future?
ROSE: Nancy, this isn't the end. I know how it looks. But it's not the end of the world or anything...
NANCY: How can you say that?? LOOK at it. 
ROSE: Listen to me. I was BORN in this city. I'm from here, in like, 50 years time. 
NANCY: From here?
ROSE: I'm a Londoner. From your future.
NANCY: But... but you're not...
ROSE: What?
NANCY: German. 
ROSE: Nancy, the Germans don't come here. They don't win. 
ROSE: Don't tell anyone I told you so, but do you know what? YOU win. 
NANCY: We win?
ROSE: Come on!
JACK: It's empty. Look at it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What do you expect in a Chula medical transporter? Bandages? Cough drops? Rose? 
ROSE: I dunno. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yes, you do.
ROSE: Nanogenes! 
NINTH DOCTOR: It wasn't empty, Captain. There was enough nanogenes in there to rebuild a species. 
JACK: Oh, God. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Getting it now, are we? When the ship crashes, the nanogenes escape. Billions upon billions of them, ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world. But what they find first is a dead child, probably killed earlier that night and wearing a gasmask.
ROSE: And they brought him back to life? They can DO that??
NINTH DOCTOR: What's life? Life's easy. A quirk of matter. Nature's way of keeping meat fresh. Nothing to a nanogene. One problem, though - these nanogenes - they're not like the ones on your ship. This lot have never seen a human being before. Don't know what a human being's supposed to look like. 
NINTH DOCTOR: All they've got to go on is one little body, and there's not a lot left. But they carry right on. They do what they're programmed to do, they patch it up. Can't tell what's gasmask and what's skull, but they do their best. Then off they fly - off they go, work to be done. 'Cos you see NOW they THINK they know what people should look like and it's time to fix all the rest. And they won't ever stop. They won't ever, ever stop. The entire Human Race is gonna be torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother, and NOTHING in the world can stop it!
JACK: I didn't know. 
NANCY: Rose?
ROSE: It's bringing the gasmask people here, isn't it? 
NINTH DOCTOR: The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling up the troops. Standard protocol. 
ROSE: But... the gasmask people aren't troops...
NINTH DOCTOR: They are now. This is a battle-field ambulance. The nanogenes don't just fix you up - they get you ready for the front line. Equip you, programme you. 
ROSE: That's why the Child's so strong. Why it could do that phoning thing.
NINTH DOCTOR: It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes. All that weapons tech in the hands of a hysterical four year old - looking for his mummy. And now there's an army of them.
JACK: Why don't they attack? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Good little soldiers. Waiting for their commander. 
JACK: The child?
NANCY: Jamie. 
JACK: What?
NANCY: Not 'the child'. Jamie.
ROSE: So, how long until the bomb falls?
JACK: Any second. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What's the matter, Captain? Bit close to the volcano for you? 
NANCY: He's just a little boy. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I know.
NANCY: He's just a little boy who wants his mummy. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I know. There isn't a little boy born who wouldn't tear the world apart to save his mummy. And this little boy can. 
ROSE: So what're we gonna DO? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't know.
NANCY: It's my fault. 
NINTH DOCTOR: No. 
NANCY: It is. It's all my fault. 
NINTH DOCTOR: How can it be your--
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy, what age are you? Twenty? Twenty-one? Older than you look, yes?
JACK: Doctor - that bomb. We've got seconds. 
ROSE: You can teleport us out. 
JACK: Not you guys. The nav-com's back online. Gonna take too long to override the protocols. 
NINTH DOCTOR: So it's volcano day. Do what you've got to do. 
ROSE: Jack?
NINTH DOCTOR: How old were you five years ago? Fifteen? Sixteen? Old enough to give birth, anyway. 
NINTH DOCTOR: He's not your brother, is he? 
NINTH DOCTOR: A teenage single mother in 1941. So you hid. You lied.
NINTH DOCTOR: You even lied to him. 
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
NINTH DOCTOR: He's gonna keep asking, Nancy. He's never gonna stop. Tell him. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nancy... the future of the human race is in your hands. Trust me... and tell him. 
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? 
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? Are you my mummy?
NANCY: Yes. Yes. I AM your mummy.
THE CHILD: Mummy?
NANCY: I'm here. 
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy?
NANCY: I'm here.
THE CHILD: Are you my mummy? 
NANCY: Yes. 
NINTH DOCTOR: He doesn't understand. There's not enough of him left.
NANCY: I am your mummy. I will always be your mummy. I'm so sorry.
NANCY: I am so, so sorry.
ROSE: What's happening? 
ROSE: Doctor, it's changing her, we should--
NINTH DOCTOR: Shh! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Come on, please. Come on, you CLEVER little nanogenes - figure it out! The mother. She's the mother! There's gotta be enough information, figure it out! 
ROSE: What's happening?
NINTH DOCTOR: See? Recognizing the same DNA. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Give me a day like this. Give me this one. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Ah-ha-ha! Welcome back! Twenty years 'til pop music - you're gonna love it. 
NANCY: What happened? 
NINTH DOCTOR: The nanogenes recognised the superior information - the parent DNA. They didn't change YOU because YOU changed them! Haha! Mother knows best! 
NANCY: Jamie...! 
ROSE: Doctor, that bomb... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Taken care of it.
ROSE: How?
NINTH DOCTOR: Psychology! 
JACK: Doctor! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Good lad! 
JACK: The bomb's already commenced detonation. I've put it in stasis but it won't last long. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Change of plan - don't need the bomb. Can you get rid of it? Safely as you can? 
JACK: Rose?
ROSE: Yeah?
JACK: Goodbye. 
JACK: By the way - love the tee-shirt. 
ROSE: What're you doing? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Software patch. Gonna email the upgrade. You want moves, Rose? I'll give you moves. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once. Everybody lives!
NINTH DOCTOR: Doctor Constantine. Who never left his patients. Back on your feet, constant doctor! World doesn't wanna get by without you just yet, and I don't blame it one bit. These are your patients. All better, now! 
DR CONSTANTINE: Yes, yes... so it seems. They also seem to be standing around in a disused railway station. Is there any particular reason for that? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah, well, you know -  cutbacks. Listen, whatever was wrong with them in the past, you're probably gonna find that they're cured. Just tell them what a great doctor you are. Don't make a big thing of it. Okay? 
And he rushes back to Rose. An old lady - Mrs Harcourt - hobbles towards Constantine.
MRS HARCOURT: Doctor Constantine. 
DR CONSTANTINE: Mrs Harcourt - how much better you are looking!
MRS HARCOURT: My leg's grown back! When I come to the hospital, I had ONE leg.
DR CONSTANTINE: Well - there is a war on. Is it possible you miscounted?
NINTH DOCTOR: Right, you lot! Lots to do! Beat the Germans, save the world - don't forget the Welfare State!
NINTH DOCTOR: Setting this to self-destruct, soon as everybody's clear. History says there was an explosion here. Who am I to argue with history?
ROSE: Usually the first in line.
NINTH DOCTOR: The nanogenes will clean up the mess and switch themselves off - because I just told them to. Nancy and Jamie will go to Doctor Constantine for help - ditto - all in all, all things considered - fantastic!
ROSE: Look at you, beaming away like you're Father Christmas!
NINTH DOCTOR: Who says I'm not, red-bicycle-when-you-were-twelve?
ROSE: What?!
NINTH DOCTOR: And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this. 
ROSE: Doctor...
NINTH DOCTOR: Go on, ask me anything. I'm on FIRE!
ROSE: What about Jack?
ROSE: Why'd he say goodbye? 
JACK: Okay, computer - how long can we keep the bomb in stasis? 
COMPUTER: Stasis decaying at ninety percent per cycle. Detonation in three minutes. 
JACK: Can we jettison it?
COMPUTER: Any attempt to jettison the device will precipitate detonation. One hundred percent probability. 
JACK: We could stick it in an escape pod. 
COMPUTER: There is no escape pod on board.
JACK: I see the flaw in that. I'LL get in the escape pod! 
COMPUTER: There is no escape pod on board. 
JACK: Did you check everywhere? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative.
JACK: Under the sink!
COMPUTER: Affirmative.
JACK: Okay. Out of one hundred... exactly how dead am I?
COMPUTER: Termination of Captain Jack Harkness in under two minutes. One hundred percent probability.
JACK: Lovely. Thanks. Good to know the numbers.
COMPUTER: You're welcome. 
JACK: Okay then.
JACK: Think we'd better initiate emergency protocol four-one-seven. 
COMPUTER: Affirmative.
JACK: Oo, a little too much vermouth. See if I come here again!  JACK: Funny thing... last time I was sentenced to death, I ordered four hyper-vodkas for my breakfast. All a bit of a blur after that. Woke up in bed with BOTH my executioners. Hmm, lovely couple. They stayed in touch!  JACK: Can't say that about most executioners. JACK: Anyway. Thanks for everything, computer. It's been great.
ROSE: Well, hurry up then! 
ROSE: Right, and turn...
ROSE: Okay, okay, try and spin me again, but this time - don't get my arm up my back! 
ROSE: No extra points for a half-nelson. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm SURE I used to know this stuff. Close the door, will you. Your ship's about to blow up - there's gonna be a draft.
NINTH DOCTOR: Welcome to the TARDIS. 
JACK: Much bigger on the inside...
NINTH DOCTOR: You'd better be. 
ROSE: I think what the Doctor's TRYING to say is... you may cut in. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose! I've just remembered!
ROSE: What? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I can dance! 
ROSE: Actually, Doctor... I thought Jack might like this dance.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm sure he would, Rose. I'm absolutely certain. But who with?
