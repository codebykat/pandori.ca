ROSE: So, what is it? What's wrong?
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't know, some kind of signal drawing the TARDIS off course...
ROSE: Where are we?
NINTH DOCTOR: Earth, Utah, North America. About half a mile underground.
ROSE: And... when are we? 
NINTH DOCTOR: 2012. 
ROSE: God, that's so close, so I should be... 26. 
ROSE: Blimey! It's a great big museum!
NINTH DOCTOR: An alien museum. Someone's got a hobby. They must've spent a fortune on this. Chunks of meteorite, moon dust... that's the milometer from the Roswell Spaceship. 
ROSE: That's a bit of Slitheen! That's a Slitheen's arm, it's been stuffed. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Ah! Look at you!
ROSE: What is it? 
NINTH DOCTOR: An old friend of mine... well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. 
ROSE: Is that where the signal's coming from? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Nah, it's stone dead. The signal's alive. Something's reaching out. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Calling for help. 
ROSE: If someone's collecting aliens, that makes you Exhibit A. 
POLKOWSKI: On behalf of all of us, I want to wish you a very happy birthday, sir. 
POLKOWSKI: And the President called to convey his personal best wishes. 
VAN STATTEN: The President is 10 points down. I want him replaced. 
POLKOWSKI: I don't think that's very wise, sir...
VAN STATTEN: Thank you so much for your opinion. You're fired. 
VAN STATTEN: Get rid of him. 
POLKOWSKI: Wha--?
VAN STATTEN: Wipe his memory, put him on the road someplace - Memphis, Minneapolis - somewhere beginning with 'M'. 
VAN STATTEN: So, the next President, what do you think? Republican or Democrat? 
GODDARD: Democrat, sir. 
VAN STATTEN: For what reason?
GODDARD: They're just so funny, sir? 
VAN STATTEN: What is your name?
GODDARD: Goddard, sir. Diana Goddard. 
VAN STATTEN: I like you, Diana Goddard.
VAN STATTEN: So, where's the English kid? 
ADAM: Sir! Sir! I bought ten more artifacts at auction, Mr. Van Statten. 
VAN STATTEN: Bring 'em on, let me see 'em. 
GODDARD: Sir, with respect, there's something more urgent. We arrested two intruders 54 floors down. We don't know how they got in. 
VAN STATTEN: I'll tell you how they got in. In'tro the window. In'tro the window, that was funny!
VAN STATTEN: Bring 'em in, let's see 'em - and tell Simmons I wanna visit my little den. Get to it!
GODDARD: Simmons? You'd better give me good news. Is it talking? 
SIMMONS: Not exactly 'talking', no. 
GODDARD: What's it doing?
SIMMONS: Screaming. Is that any good? 
ADAM: ... And this is the last... paid $800,000 for it. 
VAN STATTEN: What does it do?
ADAM: Well you see, the tubes on the side must be to channel something, I think maybe fuel... 
NINTH DOCTOR: I really wouldn't hold it like that. 
GODDARD: Shut it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Really, though, that's wrong. 
ADAM: Is it dangerous?
NINTH DOCTOR: No. Just looks silly. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You just need to be...
NINTH DOCTOR: ... delicate. 
VAN STATTEN: It's a musical instrument. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And it's a long way from home. 
VAN STATTEN: Here, let me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I did say 'delicate'. Reacts to the smallest fingerprint. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It needs precision.
NINTH DOCTOR: Very good. Quite the expert.
VAN STATTEN: As are you.
VAN STATTEN: Who exactly are you? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And who are you? 
VAN STATTEN: Like you don't know. We're hidden away with the most valuable collection of extra-terrestrial artifacts in the world and you just stumbled in by mistake. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Pretty much sums me up, yeah. 
VAN STATTEN: The question is, how did you get in? 53 floors down. With your little cat burglar accomplice.
VAN STATTEN: Quite a collector yourself, she's rather pretty. 
ROSE: She's gonna smack you if you keep calling her 'she'.
VAN STATTEN: She's English too! 
VAN STATTEN: Hey, little Lord Fauntleroy - got you a girlfriend. 
ADAM: This is Mr. Henry Van Statten. 
ROSE: And who's he when he's at home? 
ADAM: Mr. Van Statten owns the Internet. 
ROSE: Don't be stupid, no one owns the Internet. 
VAN STATTEN: And let's just keep the whole world thinking that way, right kids? 
NINTH DOCTOR: So you're an expert on just about everything except the things in your museum. Anything you don't understand, you lock up. 
VAN STATTEN: And you claim greater knowledge?
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't need to make claims, I know how good I am. 
VAN STATTEN: And yet, I captured you. Right next to the Cage. What were you doing down there?
NINTH DOCTOR: You tell me. 
VAN STATTEN: The cage contains my one living specimen. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And what's that?
VAN STATTEN: Like you don't know. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Show me. 
VAN STATTEN: You wanna see it? 
ROSE: Blimey, you can smell the testosterone.
VAN STATTEN: Goddard - inform the Cage. We're heading down.
VAN STATTEN: You - English. Look after the girl - canoodle or spoon, or whatever it is you British do. And you - Doctor with no name...
VAN STATTEN: Come and see my pet.
VAN STATTEN: We've tried everything. The creature has... shielded itself but there's definite signs of life inside. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Inside? Inside what? 
SIMMONS: Welcome back, sir. I've had to take the power down - the Metaltron is resting. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Metaltron?
VAN STATTEN: Thought of it myself. Good, isn't it? Although I'd much to prefer to find out its real name. 
SIMMONS: Here, you'd better put these on.
SIMMONS: The last guy that touched it... burst into flames. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I won't touch it then. 
VAN STATTEN: Go ahead, Doctor. Impress me. 
VAN STATTEN: Don't open that door until we get a result. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Look, I'm sorry about this. Mr. Van Statten might think he's clever, but never mind him. I've come to help. I'm the Doctor. 
DALEK: Doc-tor. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Impossible. 
DALEK: The Doctor? 
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
NINTH DOCTOR: Let me out!
DALEK: Exterminate!
GODDARD: Sir, it's gonna kill him!
VAN STATTEN: It's talking!
DALEK: You are an enemy of the Daleks! You must be destroyed!
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not working!
NINTH DOCTOR: Fantastic! Oh, fantastic!
NINTH DOCTOR: Powerless! Look at you. The Great Space Dustbin. How does it feel?
DALEK: Keep back!
NINTH DOCTOR: What for? What're you going to do to me?
NINTH DOCTOR: If you can't kill... then what are you good for, Dalek? What's the point of you?
NINTH DOCTOR: You're nothing.
NINTH DOCTOR: What the hell are you here for?
DALEK: I am waiting for orders. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What does that mean?
DALEK: I am a soldier. I was bred to receive orders. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Well you're never gonna get any. Not ever. 
DALEK: I demand orders! 
NINTH DOCTOR: They're never gonna come! Your race is dead! You all burnt, all of you. Ten million ships on fire - the entire Dalek race wiped out in one second.
DALEK: You lie! 
NINTH DOCTOR: I watched it happen. I made it happen. 
DALEK: You destroyed us? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I had no choice. 
DALEK: And what of the Time Lords? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War. Everyone lost. 
DALEK: And the coward survived. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh - and I caught your little signal... help me... poor little thing...
NINTH DOCTOR: But there's no one else coming 'cause there's no one else left. 
DALEK: I am alone in the Universe. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yep.
DALEK: So are you. 
DALEK: We are the same. 
NINTH DOCTOR: We're not the same, I'm not--
NINTH DOCTOR: No - wait. Maybe we are. You're right, yeah, okay. You've got a point. 'Cause I know what to do. I know what should happen. I know what you deserve. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Exterminate. 
DALEK: Have pity!
NINTH DOCTOR: Why should I? You never did. 
VAN STATTEN: Get him out. 
DALEK: Help me!
VAN STATTEN: I saved your life, now talk to me! Goddamn it, talk to me! 
NINTH DOCTOR: You've got to destroy it! 
VAN STATTEN: The last in the Universe. And now I know your name. Dalek. Speak to me, Dalek. 
VAN STATTEN: I am Henry van Statten, now recognize me! 
VAN STATTEN: Make it talk again, Simmons. 
VAN STATTEN: Whatever it takes. 
ADAM: Sorry about the mess. Mr. Van Statten sort of lets me do my own thing. So long as I deliver the goods...
ADAM: What do you think - that is?
ROSE: Er... a lump of metal? 
ADAM: Yeah. Yeah, but I think-- well, I'm almost certain - it's from the Hoaver Spacecraft. 
ADAM: The thing is, it's all true. Everything the United Nations tries to keep quiet - spacecrafts - aliens - visitors to Earth - they really exist. 
ROSE: That's amazing. 
ADAM: I know it sounds incredible, but I honestly believe that the whole Universe is teeming with life. 
ROSE: I'm gob-smacked, yeah. And you do what? Sit here and catalogue it? 
ADAM: Best job in the world. 
ROSE: Imagine if you could get out there. Travel amongst the stars and see it for real. 
ADAM: Yeah... I'd give anything. But I don't think it's ever gonna happen - not in our lifetimes. 
ROSE: Oh, you never know... what about all those people who say they've been inside spaceships and things and talked to aliens? 
ADAM: I think they're nutters. 
ROSE: Yeah, me too. 
ROSE: So, how'd you end up here?
ADAM: Van Statten has agents all over the world looking for geniuses to recruit. 
ROSE: Ah, right, you're a genius. 
ADAM: Sorry, but yeah... can't help it, I was born clever.
ADAM: When I was eight, I logged onto the US Defense System - nearly caused World War Three.
ROSE: What, and that's funny is it?
ADAM: Well you should've been there! Just to see them running about! Fantastic!
ROSE: You sound like the Doctor. 
ADAM: Are you and him...?
ROSE: No, we're just friends. 
ADAM: Good. 
ROSE: Why's it good?
ADAM: Just is. 
ROSE: So... wouldn't you rather be downstairs? I mean, you've got these bits of metal and stuff, but Mr. Van Statten's got a living creature down there.
ADAM: Yeah… yeah well, I did ask but he keeps it to himself. Although - if you're a genius -  it doesn't take long to patch in on the comm system. 
ROSE: Let's have a look then. 
ADAM: It doesn't do much - the alien. It's weird, it's kind of... useless, it's just like this... great big pepper pot. 
ROSE: It's being tortured! Where's the Doctor? 
ADAM: I don't know.
ROSE: Take me down there. Now. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The metal's just battle armour - the real Dalek creature's inside. 
VAN STATTEN: What does it look like?
NINTH DOCTOR: A nightmare. It's a mutation. The Dalek race was genetically engineered - every single emotion was removed except hate. 
VAN STATTEN: Genetically engineered... by whom? 
NINTH DOCTOR: By a genius, Van Statten. By a man who was king of his own little world - you'd like him.
GODDARD: It's been on Earth for over fifty years - sold at a private auction, moving from one collection to another. Why would it be a threat now? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth? Does anyone know? 
GODDARD: Records say it came from the sky like a meteorite. It fell to Earth on the Ascension Islands - burnt in its crater for nearly three days before anybody could get near it and all that time it was screaming. It must've gone insane. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Must've fallen through time. The only survivor. 
GODDARD: You talked about a war?
NINTH DOCTOR: The Time War. The final battle between my people and the Dalek race. 
VAN STATTEN: But you survived too. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Not by choice.
VAN STATTEN: This means that the Dalek isn't the only alien on Earth. 
VAN STATTEN: Doctor, there's you. The only one of your kind in existence. 
VAN STATTEN: Now, smile!
VAN STATTEN: Two hearts! Binary vascular system! Oh, I am so going to patent this. 
NINTH DOCTOR: So that's your secret. You don't just collect this stuff, you scavenge it. 
VAN STATTEN: This technology has been falling to Earth for centuries. All it took was the right mind to use it properly. Oh, the advances I've made from alien junk, you have no idea, Doctor. Broadband? Roswell. Just last year my scientists cultivated bacteria from the Russian Crater, and do you know what they found? 
VAN STATTEN: The cure for the common cold. Kept it strictly within the laboratory of course, no need to get people excited. Why sell one cure when I can sell a thousand palliatives? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Do you know what a Dalek is, Van Statten? A Dalek is honest. It does what it was born to do for the survival of its species - that creature in your dungeon is better than you.
VAN STATTEN: In that case, I will be true to myself and continue. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Listen to me, that thing downstairs is going to kill every last one of us! 
VAN STATTEN: Nothing can escape the Cage. 
NINTH DOCTOR: But it's woken up! It knows I'm here! It's gonna get out! Van Statten, I swear no one on this base is safe! No one on this planet!
BYWATER: Hold it right there!
ADAM: Level three access. Special clearance from Mr. Van Statten. 
ADAM: Don't get too close... 
ROSE: Hello? 
ROSE: Are you in pain? My name's Rose Tyler. I've got a friend, he can help. He's called the Doctor. What's your name? 
DALEK: Yes. 
ROSE: What? 
DALEK: I am in pain. They tortured me. But still they fear me. Do you fear me? 
ROSE: No. 
DALEK: I am dying. 
ROSE: No, we can help! 
DALEK: I welcome death. But I am glad... that before I die... I met a human who was not afraid.
ROSE: Isn't there anything I can do?
DALEK: My race is dead. I shall die alone. 
ADAM: Rose, no!
DALEK: Genetic material extrapolated - initiate cellular reconstruction!
SIMMONS: What the hell have you done? 
SIMMONS: Whatcha gonna do? Sucker me to death? 
ROSE: It's killing him! Do something! 
BYWATER: Condition red! Repeat, condition red! This is not a drill!
NINTH DOCTOR: Release me if you want to live. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You've got to keep it in that cell. 
ROSE: Doctor, it's all my fault. 
BYWATER: I've sealed the compartment. It can't get out, that lock's got a billion combinations. 
NINTH DOCTOR: The Dalek's a genius. It can calculate a thousand billion combinations in one second flat.
BYWATER: Open fire!
VAN STATTEN: Don't shoot it, I want it unharmed!
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, get out of there!
BYWATER: De Maggio - take the civilians and get them out alive. That is your job, got that? 
DE MAGGIO: You - with me. 
BYWATER: Abandoning the cage, sir. 
GODDARD: We're losing power. It's draining the base. Oh, my God. It's raiding entire power supplies for the whole of Utah. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's downloading.
VAN STATTEN: Downloading what?
GODDARD: Sir, the entire West Coast has gone down. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's not just energy. That Dalek just absorbed the entire Internet. It knows everything. 
DALEK: The Daleks survive in me!
GODDARD: Sir, the cameras in the vault have gone down. 
NINTH DOCTOR: We've only got emergency power, it's eaten everything else, you've got to kill it now!
GODDARD: All guards to converge in the Metaltron cage, immediately. 
DE MAGGIO: Civilians! Let them through!
BYWATER: Cover the north wall: Red division, maintain suppressing fire along the perimeter, Blue Division hold.
VAN STATTEN: Tell them to stop shooting at it! 
GODDARD: It's killing them!
VAN STATTEN: They're dispensable, that Dalek is unique. 
VAN STATTEN: I don't want a scratch on its body work! Do you hear me? Do you hear me? 
GODDARD: That's us right below the surface. That's the cage - and that's the Dalek. 
NINTH DOCTOR: This museum of yours - have you got any alien weapons? 
GODDARD: Lots of them, but the trouble is the Dalek's between us and them. 
VAN STATTEN: We've got to keep that thing alive. We could just seal the entire vault, trap it down there.
NINTH DOCTOR: Leaving everyone trapped with it? Rose is down there. I won't let that happen. Have you got that? 
NINTH DOCTOR: It's got to go through this area. What's that? 
GODDARD: Weapons testing. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Give guns to the lawyers, technicians, anyone. Everyone. Only then have you got a chance of killing it. 
ROSE: Stairs! That's more like it!
ROSE: It hasn't got legs, it's stuck! 
DE MAGGIO: It's coming! Get up! 
ADAM: Great big alien death machine. Defeated by a flight of stairs. 
DE MAGGIO: Now, listen to me. I demand that you return to your cage. If you want to negotiate then I guarantee that Mr. van Statten will be willing to talk. I accept that we imprisoned you and maybe that was wrong. But people have died, and that stops. Right now. The killing stops, have you got that? 
DE MAGGIO: I demand that you surrender, is that clear? 
DALEK: El-ev-ate. 
ROSE: Oh my God. 
DE MAGGIO: Adam, get her out of here. 
ROSE: Come with us, you can't stop it! 
DE MAGGIO: Someone's got to try. Now get out!
DE MAGGIO: Don't look back, just run!
VAN STATTEN: I thought you were the great expert, Doctor. 
VAN STATTEN: If you're so impressive, then why not just reason with this Dalek? It must be willing to negotiate - there must be something it needs, everything needs something. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What's the nearest town?
VAN STATTEN: Salt Lake City. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Population?
VAN STATTEN: One million. 
NINTH DOCTOR: All dead. If the Dalek gets out, it'll murder every living creature, that's all it needs.
VAN STATTEN: But why would it do that?! 
NINTH DOCTOR: Because it honestly believes they should die. Human beings are different, and anything different is wrong. It's the ultimate in racial cleansing and you, Van Statten, you've let it loose! 
NINTH DOCTOR: The Dalek's surrounded by a force field. The bullets are melting before they even hit home but it's not indestructible. If you concentrate your fire, you might get through. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Aim for the dome, the head, the eyepiece. That's the weak spot. 
COMMANDER: Thank you, Doctor, but I think I know how to fight one single tin robot. Positions!
COMMANDER: Hold your fire! 
COMMANDER: You two, get the hell out of there!
ROSE: It was looking at me. 
ADAM: Yeah, it wants to slaughter us!
ROSE: I know! But it was looking right at me. 
ADAM: So? It's just a sort of metal eye thing, it's looking all around!
ROSE: I don't know... it's like there's something inside looking at me, like... like it knows me.
COMMANDER: On my mark... 
COMMANDER: Open fire!
GODDARD: We've got vision. 
NINTH DOCTOR: It wants us to see. 
COMMANDER: Fall back! Fall back!
VAN STATTEN: Perhaps it's time for a new strategy, maybe we should consider abandoning this place. 
GODDARD: Except there's no power to the helipad, sir. We can't get out. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You said you could seal the vault. 
VAN STATTEN: It was designed to be a bunker. In the event of nuclear war, steel bulkheads--
GODDARD: There's not enough power, those bulkheads are massive. 
NINTH DOCTOR: We've got emergency power, we can re-route that to the bulkhead doors.
GODDARD: We'd have to bypass the security codes, that would take a computer genius!
VAN STATTEN: Good thing you've got me, then. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You want to help?
VAN STATTEN: I don't want to die, Doctor, simple as that. Nobody knows this software better than me.
GODDARD: Sir... 
DALEK: I shall speak only to the Doctor. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're gonna get rusty. 
DALEK: I fed off the DNA of Rose Tyler. Extrapolating the biomass of a time traveller regenerated me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What's your next trick? 
DALEK: I have been searching for the Daleks. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah, I saw. Downloading the Internet. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What did you find? 
DALEK: I scanned your satellites and radio telescopes. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And?
DALEK: Nothing. Where shall I get my orders now?
NINTH DOCTOR: You're just a soldier without commands. 
DALEK: Then I shall follow the primary order - the Dalek instinct to destroy! To conquer!
NINTH DOCTOR: What for? What's the point? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Don't you see, it's all gone? Everything you were, everything you stood for. 
DALEK: Then what should I do? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Alright then. If you want orders... follow this one: kill yourself. 
DALEK: The Daleks must survive! 
NINTH DOCTOR: The Daleks have failed. Why don't you finish the job and make the Daleks extinct? Rid the Universe of your filth, why don't you just die? 
DALEK: You would make a good Dalek. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Seal the vaults. 
VAN STATTEN: I can leech power off the ground defenses, feed it to the bulkheads. It's been years since I had to work this fast. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Are you enjoying this?
GODDARD: Doctor - she's still down there. 
ROSE: This isn't the best time.
NINTH DOCTOR: Where are you?
ROSE: Level 49. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You've got to keep moving - the vault's being sealed off, bulkhead level 46. 
ROSE: Can't you stop them closing?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm the one who's closing them. I can't wait and I can't help you. Now for God's sake, run.
VAN STATTEN: Done it. We've got power to the bulkheads. 
GODDARD: The Dalek's right behind them. 
ROSE: We're nearly there, give us two seconds. 
VAN STATTEN: Doctor, I can't sustain the power. The whole system is failing. 
VAN STATTEN: Doctor, you've got to close the bulkheads. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
ADAM: Come on! 
VAN STATTEN: The vault is sealed. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, where are you? Rose, did you make it? 
ROSE: Sorry, I was a bit slow. 
ROSE: See you then, Doctor. 
ROSE: It wasn't your fault. Remember that, okay? It wasn't your fault. And do you know what?
ROSE: I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
DALEK: Exterminate!
NINTH DOCTOR: I killed her. 
VAN STATTEN: I'm sorry. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I said I'd protect her. She was only here because of me, and you're sorry? I could've killed that Dalek in its cell. But you stopped me. 
VAN STATTEN: It was the prize of my collection!
NINTH DOCTOR: Your collection? But was it worth it? Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Let me tell you something, Van Statten. Mankind goes into space to explore. To be part of something greater. 
VAN STATTEN: Exactly! I wanted to touch the stars! 
NINTH DOCTOR: You just want to drag the stars down and stick them underground underneath tons of sand and dirt. And label them. You're about as far from the stars as you can get. 
NINTH DOCTOR: And you took her down with you. 
NINTH DOCTOR: She was nineteen years old. 
ROSE: Go on then, kill me.
ROSE: Why're you doing this? 
DALEK: I am armed. I will kill. It is my purpose. 
ROSE: They're all dead because of you!
DALEK: They are dead because of us. 
ROSE: And now what? What're you waiting for?
DALEK: I feel your fear. 
ROSE: What do you expect?!
DALEK: Daleks do not fear. Must not fear.
DALEK: You gave me life. What else have you given me? I am contaminated! 
NINTH DOCTOR: You were quick on your feet, leaving Rose behind. 
ADAM: I'm not the one who sealed the vault! 
DALEK: Open the bulkhead or Rose Tyler dies. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're alive!
ROSE: Can't get rid of me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I thought you were dead. 
DALEK: Open the bulkhead! 
ROSE: Don't do it!
DALEK: What use are emotions if you will not save the woman you love? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I killed her once.
NINTH DOCTOR: I can't do it again. 
VAN STATTEN: What do we do now? You bleeding heart, what the hell do we do?!
ADAM: Kill it when it gets here!
GODDARD: All the guns are useless, and the alien weapons are in the vault. 
ADAM: Only the catalogued ones. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Broken. Broken. Hairdryer. 
ADAM: Mr. Van Statten tends to dispose of his staff, and when he does he wipes their memory. I kept this stuff in case I needed to fight my way out one day. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What, you in a fight? I'd like to see that.
ADAM: I could do. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What're you gonna do, throw your A-Levels at 'em? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Lock and load. 
ROSE: I'm begging you, don't kill them - you didn't kill me. 
DALEK: But why not? Why are you alive? My function is to kill. What am I? What am I? 
ROSE: Don't move! Don't do anything, it's beginning to question itself. 
DALEK: Van Statten. You tortured me. Why?
VAN STATTEN: I wanted to help you, I just-- I don't know, I - I was just trying to help. I thought if we could get through to you, if we could mend you-- I wanted you better, I'm sorry. 
VAN STATTEN: I'm so sorry! I swear! I just wanted you to talk! 
DALEK: Then hear me talk now. Exterminate! Exterminate!
DALEK: Exterminate! 
ROSE: Don't do it! Don't kill him!
ROSE: You don't have to do this anymore. There must be something else. Not just killing-- what else is there? What d'you want? 
DALEK: I want freedom. 
ROSE: You're out. You made it. 
ROSE: Never thought I'd see the sunlight again. 
DALEK: How... does... it... feel? 
NINTH DOCTOR: Get out of the way. 
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, get out of the way, now! 
ROSE: No! 'Cause I won't let you do this!
NINTH DOCTOR: That thing killed hundreds of people. 
ROSE: It's not the one pointing the gun at me. 
NINTH DOCTOR: I've got to do this. I've got to end it. The Daleks destroyed my home, my people. I've got nothing left. 
ROSE: Look at it. 
NINTH DOCTOR: What's it doing? 
ROSE: It's the sunlight, that's all it wants! 
NINTH DOCTOR: But it can't... 
ROSE: It couldn't kill Van Statten - it couldn't kill me - it's changing. What about you, Doctor? What the hell are you changing into? 
NINTH DOCTOR: I couldn't... 
NINTH DOCTOR: I wasn't... 
NINTH DOCTOR: Oh, Rose. They're all dead. 
DALEK: Why do we survive?
NINTH DOCTOR: I don't know. 
DALEK: I am the last of the Daleks. 
NINTH DOCTOR: You're not even that. Rose did more than regenerate you. You absorbed her DNA. You're mutating.
DALEK: Into what?
NINTH DOCTOR: Something new.
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
ROSE: Isn't that better?
NINTH DOCTOR: Not for a Dalek. 
DALEK: I can feel so many ideas. So much darkness... Rose... give me orders! Order me to die. 
ROSE: I can't do that. 
DALEK: This is not life. This is sickness. 
DALEK: I shall not be like you. Order my destruction! Obey! Obey! Obey! 
ROSE: Do it. 
DALEK: Are you frightened, Rose Tyler?
ROSE: Yeah. 
DALEK: So am I. 
DALEK: Exterminate. 
VAN STATTEN: What the hell are you doing?!
GODDARD: Two hundred personnel dead, and all because of you, sir. Take him away, wipe his memory, and leave him by the road someplace. 
VAN STATTEN: You can't do this to me! I am Henry van Statten!
GODDARD: And by tonight, Henry van Statten will be a homeless, brainless junkie living on the streets of San Diego, Seattle, Sacramento.
GODDARD: Someplace beginning with 'S'.
NINTH DOCTOR: Little piece of home. Better than nothing.
ROSE: Is that the end of it? The Time War?
NINTH DOCTOR: I'm the only one left. I win. How about that.
ROSE: The Dalek survived... maybe some of your people did too.
NINTH DOCTOR: I know. In here.
NINTH DOCTOR: Feels like there's no one.
ROSE: Well then - good thing I'm not going anywhere.
NINTH DOCTOR: Yeah.
ADAM: We'd better get out. Van Statten's disappeared... they're closing down the base.
ADAM: Goddard says they're going to fill it full of cement! Like it never existed!
ROSE: About time.
ADAM: I'll have to go back home.
NINTH DOCTOR: Better hurry up then. Next flight to Heathrow leaves at 1500 hours.
ROSE: Adam was saying that all his life he's wanted to see the stars...
NINTH DOCTOR: Tell him to go and stand outside then.
ROSE: He's all on his own, Doctor. And he did help.
NINTH DOCTOR: He left you down there!
ROSE: So did you!
ADAM: What're you talking about? We've got to leave!
NINTH DOCTOR: Rose, he's a bit pretty.
ROSE: I hadn't noticed.
NINTH DOCTOR: On your own head.
ADAM: What're you doing? She said 'cement'. She wasn't joking, we're going to get sealed in.
ADAM: Doctor?
ADAM: What're you doing standing inside a box?
ADAM: Rose?
